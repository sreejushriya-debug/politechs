    "content": "In Milwaukee, 26-year-old mother Latricia Williams struggles to feed her ill four-month-old baby as costs for formula have risen to $75. In the Phoenix valley, the Villa family is stretched thin, utilizing social security checks that no longer cash in. In Orlando, Florida, Larry Robinson patiently waits for food benefits that may never arrive. All across America, the government shutdown has left 42 million Americans unsure of when their next meal will be. Even as the courts order full payments of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to continue, the Trump administration has only partially complied. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt issued a statement a few days ago claiming, \"The recipients of the SNAP benefits need to understand it's going to take some time to receive this money\". That's time that citizens like Latricia Williams, the Villa family, and Larry Robinson can't afford. However, today's ongoing issues surrounding welfare highlight a much larger problem prevalent throughout all of American history. Rugged individualism, the idea that each individual can succeed on their own without government help, is a philosophy many Americans subscribe to, even at the cost of their own livelihoods.\n\nAs Americans moved westward in the 1800's, many believed they could carve out a new life for themselves without depending on government support, leading to a culture of independence. Moreover, politicians like Herbert Hoover, Ronald Reagan, and J.D Vance have consistently condemned the idea of constituents relying on the government for help. Repeatedly, these politicians tell us to \"pull yourself up by your bootstraps\". However, doing so is physically impossible. Similarly, plenty of Americans cannot simply help themselves. For example, ten years ago, Sophia Fuller couldn't feed herself or her son. Without any help, she struggled to make ends meet. But the first time she used SNAP benefits, she felt shameful. American society, through centuries of purposeful messaging, has disparaged welfare recipients as \"lazy\" or \"not hard-working\". For Food Stamps user Whitney Lee, she thought it would be better to be dead than on welfare. The idea of Rugged Individualism is an orchestrated lie that leads to death.\n\nThe ongoing social welfare crisis caused by the government shutdown should compel us to critique the system overall. If a shutdown can be so catastrophic as to leave millions without food for a month, then is our system really effective? The answer is no. Welfare has become increasingly privatized as corporations realize there's money to be made from poverty. Indeed, fulfilling the narrative of rugged individualism, the government hands off its duties to private companies. Nearly 1 trillion dollars from the federal government goes into antipoverty programs. However, instead of directly helping its citizens, the government pays corporations to carry out its wishes. Although public-private partnerships occur across multiple sectors, such as housing, criminal justice, and nutrition, the easiest to understand is healthcare. For-profit companies are middlemen in providing healthcare services like Medicare or Medicaid. For example, Maximus, a private company receiving government contracts, routinely prioritizes \"efficiency over lives\". When Tennessee partnered with Maximus, the number of uninsured children increased by nearly 23 percent. In Kansas, a similar story. That's because for-profit companies like Maximus deny claims to squeeze out more money from their government contract. The fewer people they treat, the more money they make. But doesn't the federal government end its partnership with Maximus if the company is so ineffective in its provider care? $1,137,500. That was the total lobbying expenditure for Maximus in 2024. But it's not just healthcare. Corporate middlemen are occupying social services to a much wider extent.\n\nYes. America's flawed system of welfare shouldn't be a signal of despair. Instead, it should be a monument to resilience. Through community-based organizing, Americans have broken past the lie of rugged individualism. Today, as SNAP funding is cut, thousands of local organizations, schools, and non-profits have ran food-drives, feeding welfare recipients.",

    "content": "Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City election represents not just a local political milestone but also a shift in the political dynamics that have defined American politics and the Democratic Party. His win signals that embracing socialist, pro-Palestine beliefs and rejecting establishment ideals is now a defining current within politics. Mamdani, now the first Muslim, first millennial, and first South Asian mayor of New York City. His left-wing platform that embraced affordability as the priority, focusing on housing, free public transit, taxation of the ultra-wealthy, and public services, has shown to be popular. What was once dismissed as \"too radical\" a message has now inspired the highest turnout in decades, and proved that his message resonated with millions.\n\nHis victory also shows how effective grassroots movements that grow over social media can be over traditional political machinery, where connections were once thought to be key. Mamdani turned the tide of polling in months by mobilizing the youngest voters, appearing across working-class neighborhoods, creating videos in multiple languages for immigrant communities, and engaging communities that generally were ignored by traditional strategies. Instead of relying on billionaire donors or centrist policies, his campaign drew power from door-to-door outreach and its diehard focus on a livable city. For the Democratic National Committee, the lesson is clear: the future of the party relies on new methods of organizing.\n\nZohran's victory also speaks to the gaps within generations in our countries. For older generations, owning a home and supporting a family could be done through a middle class job, but that is no longer the reality. While establishment candidates like Cuomo represented the older generation's instincts, Mamdani's policies reflected the younger cohort's desire for change, mirroring national trends where housing inequality and economic clarity are top priorities. The DNC must adapt to this shift among their base, or they risk alienating the voters that define their future. If the party continues resisting signs that progressive candidates are popular and feasible candidates, they may not see success in national election cycles.\n\nLooking at this election, the Democratic Party should have a deep look at their strategies in 2026 and 2028. A single progressive victory in a deeply Democratic city doesn't automatically guarantee universal success nationwide. But the rise of progressivism across the nation, with candidates gaining support through social media, shows that this trend is widespread. A national approach by the party towards the issues that appeal towards younger voters the most is necessary.\n\nAnother crucial step looking forward is ensuring that Mamdani delivers on his promises. Campaigning on radical change is popular and builds support, but actually delivering on those promises determines whether or not a political movement will maintain popularity and sustain itself. If progressive governance succeeds in the most important city in the world, it will embolden socialist policies around the world, and recalibrate what voters expect from their leaders. But if implementation falters, whether through ineffective execution or gridlock with the state government, his governance could be weaponized as a failure by opponents of left-wing politics. Thus, the party's support for Zohran must also extend to his new policy infrastructure, coordination, funding, and staffing.\n\nUltimately, Zohran Mamdani's election shows that the tides of politics are shifting. It challenges the DNC to rethink its focus on appeasing billionaire donors, and start speaking on issues that are really important to the young generation. For Democrats seeking a path to political success in an age of political inequality, Mamdani's victory offers a roadmap, and a glimpse of hope in an age of authoritarianism in Washington D.C.",

    "content": "In the late 1800s, the American frontier had been thoroughly explored, conquered, and divided. As railroads expanded from coast to coast, Americans witnessed the rise of Big Business consolidating resources such as iron and oil. Indeed, business practices such as horizontal integration and interlocking directorates became commonplace as a way to form dynastic monopolies. Today, it's no longer the American frontier at the fingertips of Big Business; it's the digital frontier. Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon all fight for the number one spot to buy up and own as much of the internet as possible. However, the problem with monopolization has always been homogeneity. In the late 19th century, the massive trusts led to a sharp decrease in the American working class's quality of living. Similarly, today's digital monopolies affect the average consumer's ability to successfully navigate the online landscape. Just yesterday, Amazon Web Services (AWS) suffered massive outages, affecting millions worldwide. Although the issue has been resolved, the incident is a stark reminder of the danger digitalized monopolies hold on 21st century society. Indeed, an AWS shutdown affected nearly every sector, ranging from commerce to education, showcasing the need for economic diversification.\n\n**How the \"Network Effect\" led to Monopolization**\n\nThe network effect is defined as the value of a product increasing when more people utilize said product. For example, a fax machine on its own may be useful, yet when more fax machines are introduced across a town, the value of the first fax machine increases in an interconnected network. The internet has always had a high volume of network effects taking hold of the market. For digital platforms, the more users that operate in the space means higher value. Indeed, the network effect galvanizes Big Tech to expand as widely as possible in order to increase shareholder value. Moreover, in the digital world, the more data that exists in a platform, the more profitable it becomes. That's again because of the network effect. For example, the data of millions of users makes Google's algorithms more refined. In the case of AWS, an increase in data they have on consumer preferences increases the effectiveness of targeted advertising. Thus, companies race to the top in order to consolidate as much data into one place.\n\nAWS encompasses many different services, from social media to gaming to financial security. If the majority of America's data is stored with one cloud-based company, then just one cybersecurity breach could be devastating. Indeed, with over 2,000 companies affected in the recent shutdown, a cascading effect is an inevitability. The fragile cloud-based infrastructure could leave millions of Americans at risk because of Big Tech's greed.\n\nIn the Gilded Age, we fought monopolies through antitrust legislation. Today, politicians from both sides of the aisle are unfortunately afraid to go after their huge corporate sponsors. However, the monopolization of the digital frontier presents many challenges to consumers through cybersecurity concerns. Abroad, the AWS outages have shed light on the idea of limiting global reliance on U.S tech to avoid potential future cascading effects. Although legislation abroad may not directly break up the Big Tech monopoly, it will decrease the disastrous effects in the case of cybersecurity concerns. Overall, digitalized monopolies only hurt the U.S, not help.",

    "content": "For decades, the U.S has remained racially divided through the purposeful development of infrastructure meant as a way to protect systems of segregation and inequality. Highways, public transportation, and sidewalks all contribute to the problem. Today, the long-lasting effects are visible in the way inequality persists. Indeed, the legacy of Jim Crow is far from over in our country.\n\n**Yes, highways are racist.**\n\nInterstate highways are conveniently located in the midst of predominantly black communities. In Syracuse, New York, the creation of I-81 led to the displacement of over 1,300 Black families. Indeed, vibrant communities of color were systemically cut off from bustling downtown centers through careful placement of roads. Even worse, black communities were turned into sacrifice zones close to industrial waste, landfills, and power plants. As white suburbs saw an increase in public investment and funding into infrastructure, black communities were forcefully denied opportunity. U.S infrastructure was, and is, built for white people. The Federal Highways Act of 1956 itself was meant to facilitate the mass exodus of white families away from cities and into suburbs. As a result, black populations in city centers were left in the dust with reduced public investment. Nearly 70 years later, black communities are still stuck in poverty due to the purposeful development of unequal infrastructure.\n\nThe problem is not simply a lasting effect from racist policy passed decades ago; highway expansion and infrastructure continue to resegregate America. In the state of Arizona, the recent Loop 202 expansion has come at the cost of black and brown communities living in South Phoenix, an area historically written off as \"unsafe\". The controversial development has added thousands of miles to the freeway by bisecting the South Mountain, further cutting off South Phoenix from the predominantly white Ahwatukee. Yet, the richer, whiter Ahwatukee has received nearly $12 million in damages because of the construction's effect on \"noise, pollution, and visual obstructions. On the other side of the expansion, black and brown populations received a total sum of $0 despite living in far worse conditions deemed as \"sacrifice zones\". Redlining, the process of denying financial assistance to specific racial communities, is outlawed. However, through the expansion of highways, many states get away with zoning off black and brown people, leading to limited opportunities and disinvestment.\n\nIt's not just highways that divide communities. Across America, public transportation is riddled with inequities through ineffectual urban planning designed to force the black community into worse situations. First, when highways divided black communities, the result was isolation, with nowhere to go. Then, redlining led to the sporadic and often scattered placement of public transportation. Ultimately, predominantly black communities became \"transportation deserts\". Bus stops are typically miles away from areas in which African Americans reside, creating unsafe commutes to work, school, grocery shopping, and especially healthcare. In Dayton, Ohio, a pregnant woman spoke about her daily 1.5-mile commute to her minimum wage job. A couple of minutes into the walk, the sidewalk completely ends. For the rest of her journey, she risks her life by walking across the broken shoulder of the I-165 highway. Regardless of hot summer days, icy winters, the dead of night, or any other environmental limitation, the commute remains the same. She, and many others, are isolated from receiving the help they need. The lack of public transportation in our country is evidence enough of systemic racism.\n\n**The solution is political organizing.**\n\nThe Biden Administration fought to aid communities affected by highway segregation through a billion-dollar investment. However, there is wide concern that even well-intentioned urban planning could lead to similar effects once again. Moreover, in its time, the Biden Administration promised chances for renewal, yet time and time again, it failed to provide meaningful change to systemic issues. For example, in Texas, the federal government halted expansion of the interstate highway for nearly two years before simply allowing the project to continue. So, if U.S policymakers at the national level consistently overlook and worsen structural oppression, then what's the solution? Organize. Today, thousands of community members advocate for a public infrastructure framework based on racial equity. Through lobbying urban planners, city officials, and architects at the local level, the possibility of equitable transportation systems in our lifetimes is much higher. In Portland, Oregon, new, progressive policies accounting for black livelihoods have helped many. Indeed, these policies were born out of protest and political organizing. Although new legislation isn't perfect, through further organizing and activism, local change can be observed at the local level.\n\nRemember, the fight isn't over. Our policymakers today aim to resegregate America through legal loopholes and disinvestment. Tackling systemic racism is difficult. When centuries of bigotry inform policymaking decisions, breaking out of that same system proves to be a troublesome task. Yet, community-based activism and organizing can help alleviate some of the conditions faced by Black communities across the globe.",

    "content": "For decades, what has stopped the adoption of the most environmentally feasible energy source has been fear, born from decades of misinformation and misunderstanding. Headlines from sources sponsored by gas lobbies have portrayed nuclear energy as a technology fraught with danger, but beneath that narrative lies an irony: the very energy source that has the potential to save our planet is the one that the public fears the most.\n\nAs climate change is only accelerating and global energy demand is surging, the world stands at an important time in choosing an energy source to adopt. Unless misconceptions about nuclear power are addressed, its adoption will be slowed, despite overwhelming scientific evidence of its benefits. Below are the 5 most common lies stopping nuclear energy from adoption, and why they are inaccurate.\n\n**Myth #1 - \"Nuclear energy is unsafe.\"**\n\nMany people have been led to believe that nuclear energy is high-risk because of past accidents like Chernobyl or Fukushima. But, looking at empirical evidence, the long-term record of nuclear power plants shows a strong performance in safety. Nuclear energy results in 99.8% fewer deaths than coal, 99.7% fewer than oil, 97.6% fewer than gas, and the same amount as wind and solar are just as safe. At the same time, the risk of accidents is only declining. Unless Soviet systems with low standards, modern safety systems are engineered with multiple robust safety layers, including reactors designed to withstand earthquakes and other extreme conditions. While concerns arising from the toll from accidents like Fukushima are understandable, these events are rare and only decreasing, and their impact is near-zero compared to the ongoing toll of fossil fuel pollution.\n\n**Myth #2 - \"Nuclear plants emit dangerous levels of radiation to the public.\"**\n\nSome fear that living anywhere near a nuclear facility is equivalent to shortening your own life span. But, as the Duke Energy Center explains, someone standing outside the perimeter of a nuclear power plant for a full year would receive less than one millirem of extra radiation. For context, a typical X-ray delivers around 10 millirems of radiation. Further, the average American receives about 620 millirem of radiation exposure yearly, mostly from natural sources. Living near a nuclear plant is roughly equal to eating a few bananas. Contrary to public perception, the engineering of plants ensures that members of the public aren't exposed to radiation. Even after crisis, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) concluded that the resulting radiation exposure posed \"no discernible increase in cancer rates.\"\n\n**Myth #3 – \"Nuclear waste is unmanageable and unsolvable\"**\n\nThere has been a persistent notion that using nuclear energy generates a vast, untamable amount of toxic waste. Yet, the reality is far more reassuring. The volume of used fuel is very different, and the volume of waste is very small relative to other sources. All the nuclear waste produced by the U.S. over the past 60 years could fit on a single football field stacked less than 10 yards high. Far from \"unmanageable,\" the waste is stored safely in sealed casks made of steel that are constantly monitored. In countries like Finland and Sweden, there are deep repositories where waste can be stored in stable rock formations. Furthermore, around 90% of what we now consider nuclear waste can be reprocessed into new fuel, a technique already used in France.\n\n**Myth #4 - \"Nuclear power is too expensive and economically impractical.\"**\n\nThere is some truth to the notion that nuclear plants have upfront capital costs, but that is only part of the story. New technologies for nuclear energy, such as SMRs(Small Modular Reactors), have greatly decreased the costs of adoption. In the long run, nuclear energy lowers costs, having the lowest levelized cost of electricity among all sources over its lifespan, producing far more electricity per unit of installed capacity than wind or solar. The problem is one of favorable regulations, not costs. In nations with favorable climates to nuclear energy, like China and South Korea, new reactors are built within years at competitive costs. The problem isn't economics, it's political will.\n\n**Myth #5 - \"Renewables alone can replace the need for nuclear power.\"**\n\nGiven the aforementioned myths, another notion has arisen that wind and solar can solve our climate crisis, leaving nuclear energy unnecessary. However, this simply isn't the case. These renewable sources are intermittent, depending on weather conditions, daylight, and geography. Without massive energy sources from other sources, they can not sustain society. Grids that try to maintain energy using only nuclear sources face not only soaring costs but also storage challenges. Adding nuclear to the mix greatly reduces both the cost and emissions from a grid. Achieving net-zero emissions will require renewables to be greatly complemented by nuclear energy.",

Today, the ongoing conflict between two militant groups, the RSF and the SAF, has led to as many as 150,000 people killed, over 14 million displaced, and the world's worst famine in decades. Just yesterday, attacks on an El Fasher hospital resulted in hundreds of deaths. New satellite images reveal that the bloodshed in Sudan is visible even in outer space. While Sudan suffers, multiple international actors stand to benefit.\n\n**U.A.E. profits from Sudanese suffering**\n\nThe Rapid Sudanese Forces are currently advancing on civillian territories, causing violence throughout the North Darfur state. In the past 18 months, the RSF has denied access to food and water for communities living under constant bombardment. 1,711 miles away, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has sent resources, propaganda, and weapons to back the violent militia's targeting of civilians. But why? The Gulf state aims to keep a stronghold of political power in order to advance its economic interests of exploiting the rich natural resources in Sudan. Emirati monarchs view the country as a literal goldmine for minerals, resources, and trade. Thus, they're willing to do anything to protect their interests, including carrying out a genocide.\n\nMoreover, the UAE's international meddling serves as a way to advance Western interests. Both America and Israel show deep commitment to the UAE's goals of consolidating power. In 2025, the U.S is set to invest $60 billion in UAE energy projects, the same energy the RSF had to kill thousands of Sudanese citizens to get. Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and President Donald J. Trump have shaken hands, both bloodied. The UAE's relationship with Israel is even more sinister. Just two days ago, an Israeli private defense company established a subsidiary in the UAE with over 30 billion dollars in investment.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates dynasty has strong cultural soft power from Dubai's reputation as a luxurious city to the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England. However, as global citizens, we have a duty to stand up to a genocide driven by profit and backed by the West. As everyday civilians, it can become overwhelming to read or hear about mass killings we have no power over. However, any action is better than inaction. Through purposeful boycotts of UAE-owned companies, media, and products, we can send a powerful message. There must be a collective boycott of the UAE until it ceases its enabling of genocide in Sudan.",

    "content": "High-speed rail isn't a perfect form of transportation. What it is, however, is a necessary tool for any developed economy to achieve efficient transport and meet climate goals. In a time defined by a lack of jobs, clogged highways, and the risk of climate collapse, HSR offers fast, low-carbon mobility. The opposition, often funded by the car lobby, often relies on myths that collapse under simple scrutiny.\n\n**Myth 1: \"High-speed rail doesn't meaningfully cut emissions\"**\n\nRail, by far and undeniably, is the fastest way to move a lot of people at high speeds, especially when electrified, and supported by a renewable grid. Implementing high speed rail can reduce air pollutants by up to 90 percent, cut overall carbon emissions, and support growth in the renewable sector. At worst, even when not supported by a renewable grid, high speed rail has around 1/10th of the footprint of planes. At the same time, high speed rail is 10 times more fuel efficient than alternatives. In the U.S., even non HSR-based analyses echo this: electrified segments of American intercity rail dramatically undercut aviation's emissions.\n\n**Myth 2: \"High-speed rail is too expensive; widening highways and airports is cheaper.\"**\n\nFirst, making a investment in a country for transportation is known to boost productivity, increase efficiency, and stimulate tourism and the economy. For example, every single year, the U.S. government spends around $400 billion on highways. We've seen this argument, empirically, not be true just be the fac that other developed countries, such as China, have developed substantial networks in around 10 years. The alternative, of adding more road capacity, with every 10% capacity increase leading to ~7–10% higher rate of traffic. After implementing HSR, countries experience an overage increase of 2.7% to GDP, showing that the investment does pay off. The Acela express, the only line in the U.S. that could briefly be said to have HSR(albeit on the slower side,) generates 63% of Amtrak's profit.\n\n**Myth 3: \"The U.S. can't build HSR; it only works in Europe or Asia.\"**\n\nThe biggest thing stopping projects from working has been anti-rail regulations implemented by the car lobby. Recently however, progress on projects such as Brightline West between Southern California and Las Vegas are gaining federal and private funding, showing that projects are working. The problem has constistnyl been political will, not geography. The U.S. has several corridors:the Northeast Corridor, the Texas Triangle (Dallas-Houston-San Antonio), and the Cascadia region (Portland-Seattle-Vancouver), that are dense enough and have inter-city distances (200–500 miles) that are ideal for HSR and are comparable to successful routes in Europe and Asia. However, unlike most HSR systems globally where the track is state-owned and dedicated to passenger service, the U.S. rail network is primarily owned by private freight companies. This means any new HSR must either share congested, slow tracks or build entirely new, dedicated corridors, significantly increasing costs. Government investment into rail, like is commonplace in other areas, would alleviate this issue. The U.S. lacks the coordinated planning and dedicated long-term funding streams that built HSR in France, Japan, or China. As a result, projects are subjected to changing political winds, opposition, and legal battles. However, there still is examples that HSR is feasible. The U.S. already has examples and projects proving HSR is feasible: between DC and NYC Amtrak runs the Acela at 150mph, Brightline is operating at speds up to 125mph in parts of track in Florida, and projects elsewhere are gaining funding.\n\n**Myth 4: \"HSR drains local economies, and creates gentrification\"**\n\nHigh speed rail, if implemented across the U.S., is projected to, for every direct job in the railway supply sector, create 4.2 additional jobs in other industries, supporting 4.87 million jobs in total, and 1.16 million for the project. When creating a more efficient transport system, local economies see the benefits. Spending circulates through small businesses and local suppliers, creating jobs both on and off the tracks. Even in intermediate cities, HSR opened up new opportunities by increasing their accessibility and interconnectivity, like the cases of Cordoba and Zaragoza in Spain.\n\nAny major transportation investment, if done without precautions, could increase a neighborhood's desirability and lead to rising property values. However, the root cause isn't HSR, and at best HSR projects can just add to existing market trends. The true driver of gentrification is the unregulated housing market and a lack of supply of affordable housing in high-demand areas. However, there are several ways to mitigate this. Many cities globally implement \"Transit-Oriented Development\" strategies that include equity mandates, which plan the surrounding area to include mandatory percentages of affordable housing and create community land trusts before construction begins, to ensure affordabili. Also, the increase in land value created by the public investment in HSR can be taxed or captured by the government to fund anti-displacement measures such as rental assistance and/or property tax freezes for long-term low-income homeowners, and even new affordable housing construction. Lastly, placing stations in already developed, dense downtown areas, can minimize the direct displacement of existing residents and businesses.\n\n**Myth 5: \"HSR wouldn't be used\"**\n\nThe reason why this notion seems convincing to people in the U.S. is exactly because we have a culture where HSR is so foreign. In cities, like New York City, where investment into public transportation is high, usage of such infrastructure is also high. However even when asking them directly, 63% of Americans sau were likely to use HSR if it were available today, showing high public support. When modern rail service is offered, ridership quickly exceeds projections. Brightline's Miami–Orlando service, for instance, hit over three million riders its 2 years, outperforming many regional airlines on the same corridor. Once systems are implemented, convenience, not \"car culture,\" is the primary determinant of mode choice. When travel time and price are competitive, rail becomes the preferred mode for trips under 500 miles.",

    "content": "Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is heralded by policymakers, consumers, and corporations as the ultimate indicator of a country's financial status. However, reality paints an entirely different picture. On paper, a higher GDP means an increased quality of living. The connection is logical. If the economic output of a country increases, then that money surely goes to the people, right? Not necessarily. Despite growth in per capita GDP, many countries across the globe do not see an increase in the material conditions for their citizens or an increase in the well-being of their citizens. That's because the global economy is nuanced, with more than just one factor entirely controlling its direction.\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) is a comprehensive measure of a nation's economy calculated by the nation's total market value of all goods and services produced. GDP is an integral part of Keynesian economic theory as a way to track Britain's post-war economy. However, as famous columnist George Monbiot says, \"the problem with gross domestic product is the gross bit\". Since GDP only encompasses the total amount an economy produces, it often disregards the effects of production. Hypothetically, let's say a deadly car crash occurs. The cost of repairs, medical bills, and funeral costs all add up to $100,000 in the economy. GDP deems the car crash as a positive.\n\nGDP aims for infinite growth in a world with finite resources. The measure of a nation's overall production does not consider the environment. For example, a total $1bn in revenue for car sales is only seen as a positive under the GDP outlook of the world. However, we know that $1bn in car sales will likely contribute to environmental degradation through carbon emissions. The issue is that policymakers across the globe rely on GDP as a reliable indicator of economic policy. For a country like Ethiopia, GDP is set to expand. However, the people of the Oromia region are suffering from the worst drought in 40 years, and Geze Gofa is experiencing massive landslides, leading to unsafe conditions. Unstable weather patterns and an all-time high temperature are caused by carbon emissions contributing to the greenhouse gas effect. Yet, for policymakers, a rising GDP may be a signal to continue more of the governance that has led to many precarious climate scenarios.\n\nClearly, the over-reliance on GDP as an economic measure can lead to drastic impacts simply because GDP does not include the negative effects of production. As Robert Kennedy famously noted, GDP measures \"everything except that which makes life worthwhile\". So, what can we use instead? There are many alternative metrics, such as the U.N.'s \"Inclusive Wealth Report\" (IWR) or UNDP's Human Development Index (HDI). All these alternatives take into consideration the economy's effects on its people. The issue, however, is the worldwide reluctance to switch frameworks. But why?\n\nSimply put, the global use of GDP is purposeful. Utilizing a system that doesn't account for lived experiences and human harm is a tool of capitalism to decenter the economy away from humanity. GDP is a system that isn't built for humans. It is built for economic growth, regardless of the effects.\n\nGDP does not always equate to a better life. The growing disconnect between the economy and the people represents a larger symptom of the disease that is capitalism. The economy should work for the people, not for itself. The widespread adoption of GDP as the universal indicator for a country's well-being is another ploy to separate humanity from our global economic system. That's because GDP does not account for the negative effects of economic production. Instead, GDP calls for infinite growth while disregarding the very people the economy should benefit.",

    "content": "In the emotionally charged debates that often surround gun control, myths often gain credibility over data. In a time with increasing political, school, and general gun violence, accurate information surrounding the accuracy of firearms is necessary. Below sums up 5 myths around gun violence, and why they aren't accurate.\n\n**Myth 1: \"More guns make us safer.\"**\n\nPutting more deadly weapons in the hands of people does the opposite. We've seen the effects of widespread firearm usage in the United States. According to the Centre for Gun Violence Solutions at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the U.S. recorded 46,728 firearms-related deaths in 2023, an average of one every 11 minutes. Households with a gun face not only higher risks of homicide, but also a higher risk of suicide. Mass gun ownership as a tool of \"self-protection\" isn't held up in data. For example, in California, those living with guns are twice as likely to die by homicide. Having easy access to a deadly weapon increases the chance for an argument to escalate.\n\n**Myth 2: \"Criminals don't obey laws, so gun control won't work.\"**\n\nMaking it harder for criminals to obtain weapons makes it harder for them to commit a crime. A multi-decade study of U.S. states found that those that had laws requiring universal background checks and permits were associated with a 15.4% reduction in homicide rates and an 18.3% reduction in homicides. In states with more gun-safety legislation, firearm-death rates are lower. Even if some criminals can find ways to avoid laws, they still make a difference at the population level.\n\n**Myth 3: \"Mass shootings are caused primarily by mental illness.\"**\n\nWhile this may be true to some level, allowing people with mental illness easy access to weapons through weaker gun safety laws is the root of the problem. While mental illness is a factor in some individual cases, it would not explain the widespread and chronic gun violence. Compared to other nations with equal or higher prevalence of mental health disorders, America has much higher mass shooting and firearm homicide rates. While allocating resources towards mental health is still essential, treating this as the main issue distracts from gun safety policy that is necessary to save lives.\n\n**Myth 4: \"Universal background checks and other laws won't reduce violence.\"**\n\nMaking sure that someone buying a gun doesn't face mental illnesses and/or a history of crime is essential to prevent violence, especially when over 20 percent of gun buyers are buying firearms without a background check. Universal background checks, with a permit-to-purchase requirement, were associated with an 18.3% decrease in homicides. Given that 93% of Americans favor background checks, including 89% of gun owners, the only force stopping policymakers is NRA lobbying.\n\n**Myth 5: \"Stricter gun laws mean the government is taking away guns.\"**\n\nPolicy around gun safety isn't focused on \"taking away 2nd amendment rights,\" simply reducing access for individuals who pose a high risk to society. For example, \"red-flag\" laws, which are enacted in 21 states + DC, have been shown to prevent suicides and potential shootings for those deemed a threat to themselves or others. In Connecticut, such laws were associated with a 13.7% decrease in firearm suicides. The myth that regulation = confiscation fuels polarisation and blocks bipartisan reform on widely supported measures. No major federal proposal in modern history has sought blanket confiscation. Instead, policies have aimed to ensure that those who have the legal right to own guns can do so safely, and those who pose a risk to society are restricted.",

    "content": "The Department of Education is in a fragile state. As the Trump Administration has sought to completely dismantle it, attacks on the Department of Education are rampant. Today, the government shutdown, in its tenth day, has led to massive layoffs for federal workers. Yet, education seems to be hit particularly hard.\n\nThe shutdown started on October 1st when Congress failed to pass appropriations for funding for the following year. After weeks of internal chaos stemming from reckless Trump Administration actions, layoffs were announced. Indeed, the federal government is planning to lay off nearly 4,000 federal government workers.\n\nThe Education Department has already suffered massive layoffs over the last two weeks, with nearly 87% of employees suspended/discharged from their jobs. Now, even more layoffs will occur across multiple departments. So, without federal employees in education, what happens to students? The effect of a weaker education workforce means a worse environment for students. Offices that oversee crucial programs such as Title I or the Every Student Succeeds Act will now suffer from massive cuts to funding and oversight. Fortunately, federal student aid is not impacted by the government shutdown, as Pell grants and federal loans are still distributed to students through FAFSA. Moreover, student loan borrowers are still able to make their payments even through the shutdown. On the higher education side, research and federal grant funding could be negatively impacted. Let's look at previous shutdowns as precedent. Funding lapses have historically led to delays, backlogs, and cancellations of important university projects. This time around, it's no different, as federal research funding is clearly not a priority of the current administration or policymakers. Moreover, during a shutdown, the enforcement of civil rights laws in schools shuts down, meaning new litigation cannot occur. In addition, education-related court cases against the Trump Administration are also on pause due to the shutdown. Broadly speaking, no new funding can be appropriated in order to help education throughout the year until the government reopens.\n\nEducation relies on the federal government in many key aspects. This month's shutdown represents a huge problem for the education sector at an even worse time. As Trump continually attacks public education, the department is in a rough state. Ultimately, Trump's attacks on education serve as a way of escalating his privatization policy goals. In K-12 education, cutting public funding to schools in favor of private establishments has been the goal of republicans all over the country for decades. Even deeper, education is the frontline against authoritarianism. Damaging higher education and elementary through secondary education is a method of quelling dissent. That's why it's so crucial to fight for education.",

    "content": "Israel and Hamas recently announced a ceasefire and hostage exchange deal, a breakthrough after two years of genocide, and a good step towards ending the suffering in Gaza. For those in Palestine who care for Palestinian liberation, the ceasefire should be seen as a good step, not a destination.\n\nIn the agreement, the ceasefire involves Israel having a staged withdrawal from Gaza, the release of hostages, and Israel's freeing of hundreds of Palestinian hostages. Israel has stated that it is committed to the agreement, although this is questionable, as they have a history of over 1,000 violations. Hamas has been committed to handing over hostages, although maintaining that the occupation and blockade must end. But even in these modest gains, Israel still maintains control over borders, airspace, maritime waters, and supply chains.\n\nFor Gazans, this ceasefire is a light in a dark tunnel. The immediate promise of food, basic medicine, and a chance of reconstruction would sound like heaven to anyone facing bombing, displacement, and ethnic cleansing. But this relief cannot undo structural violence. Hundreds of thousands have still died or been displaced. The dynamics of power and infrastructure remain under Israeli authority. Any hope of reconstruction is still conditional on Israeli security clearances and bureaucratic controls. In the past, Israel has delayed approvals for permits, withheld materials, and overall condemned Gazans to worse conditions.\n\n3. The Political Factor\n\nIn Washington, the ceasefire is being celebrated by the Trump administration as a diplomatic victory for durable peace. This masks three key facts: 1) The U.S. has supplied Israel with billions in funding that allowed the genocide to occur in the first place. 2) Trump's original peace deal from when he first came into office didn't last. 3) Internationally, the U.S. has shielded Israel with diplomatic cover and vetoes any accountability at the U.N. The ceasefire's success depends on international pressure, and that pressure is unlikely to be lasting, coming from the U.S.\n\nIn Israel, Netanyahu is facing backlash for what some see as capitulation during the \"war.\" Many ministers are raising the threat from Gaza, and many are promising to block ratification of the peace deal. For many in the Israeli government, anything short of the extermination of the Palestinian people isn't enough.\n\n4. The Precedent of Collapse\n\nCeasefires in Gaza have historically been short-lived. As previously stated, Israel has violated ceasefires over 1000 times. Many of these times, these violations were denied by Israel, falsely claiming that it was Palestinian resistance groups that had attacked forces. Israel, time and time again, has broken truces with airstrikes and with aid, prompting spirals back into war. The lack of any international mechanisms for accountability threatens the resilience of the deal.\n\nThe ceasefire is a fragile, but essential moment of reprieve in the bombardment of Gaza. It offers temporary relief from bloodshed and modest diplomatic gains. But it does not resolve the underlying problems: the occupation, the dispossession of Palestinian lands, apartheid, and the denial of Palestinian self-determination. Only through a permanent path towards liberation can decolonization occur.",

    "content": "No. Peace deals and ceasefires are constantly violated by Israel, thus decreasing trust between Palestinian authorities and Israel. At the time of writing, mutual hostage agreements have been reached between Hamas and Israel. However, considering Israel's repeated history of violating deals, we should approach today's news with caution. For example, in February, a ceasefire deal struck was violated 962 times. Moreover, international peace agreements often come at the cost of Palestinian autonomy. Even worse, legislation is written with loopholes to allow for Israel's never-ending escalation. For more information, refer to 'How Palestine is Abandoned in International Relations' and 'The Invisible Deaths of Palestinians in Israeli Custody'\n\nNo. The Zionist movement is not the same thing as Judaism. Zionism is the belief in a Jewish national homeland. Judaism is an Abrahamic monotheistic ethnic religion. Not every Zionist is a Jew. In fact, many Zionists, were, and still are, antisemitic. For example, Lord Balfour, namesake of the Balfour declaration, believed in keeping Jews out of Britain and expressly believed the creation of a Jewish national homeland would serve his antisemitic goals. Not every Jew is a Zionist. Many Jewish advocacy groups today have been outspoken against Zionism and Israel's ongoing occupation of Palestine. Moreover, in the Zionist movements early beginnings, many Jewish intellectuals rejected ethnic and religious separation.\n\nThis Argument relies on mentions from the Book of Joshua, using religious stories that are often not taken literal to justify ethnic cleansing. Decades of fieldwork across the southern Levant do not corroborate the Book of Joshua's account of the annihilation of Canaanite cities. Ze'ev (Zev) Herzog, then head of Tel Aviv University's Institute of Archaeology, summarized the mainstream view: there is no archaeological trace of a mass Exodus, Sinai wanderings, or a swift conquest and allotment to 12 tribes. At most, the \"United Monarchy\" of David/Solomon was a small chiefdom.\n\nThe notion that Rome expelled an entire people from Judea after 70–135 CE lacks support in Roman administrative records and in archaeology. Israel J. Yuval shows the \"exile after the Second Temple\" story was later theologized; most Jews were not forcibly deported en masse, and Jewish presence in Palestine continued. The political slogan \"return after exile\" is often presented as singular, but the record shows population continuity and religious shifts across centuries instead. Many Jews in the region either voluntarily left, or converted to Islam and are Palestinians today.\n\nPalestine has existed for centuries. Herodotus refers to \"Palaistinē Syria\" in the 5th century BCE; Rome renamed the province \"Syria Palaestina\" in the 2nd century CE; and the Byzantine state later subdivided it into Palaestina Prima/Secunda/Salutaris. Israeli colonists didn't even deny this because, at the time, colonialism was normalized. They referred to Palestinians as an indigenous population they had to colonize, and even had a \"Palestinian Colonization Association.\"\n\nIgnoring all of this, even if the biblical memories of Jews in modern day Palestine, this doesn't decide sovereignty. Standards apply separate of what ancestors did 3,000 years ago because 1) There was a population living there before the Jews would have lived there and 2) By this Zionist logic, Italians have a right to exist in all of Europe because of the Roman Empire\n\nPalestine has long had overlapping communities, Judaean/Israelite, Samaritan, Christian, Muslim, changing through conversion, migration, and empire. Many present-day Palestinians descend in part from ancient local populations, just as many Jews descend from multiple diasporic lineages. Using one selective thread of antiquity to negate the others is historically thin.\n\nClaim 4: Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East\n\nNo. A democracy, at its core, cannot fundamentally oppress its minority groups. Israel continues undemocratic practices by denying Palestinians access to their homeland while simultaneously carrying out ethnic cleansing. The state of Israel defines itself as an entirely Jewish. The democratic idea of 'majority rule' only applies to members of the Jewish faith. That's why the state tries to remove religious minority (non-Jewish) citizens. The nation quite literally cannot be democratic due to its focus on preserving its Jewish demographic majority. Moreover, the Israeli government silences dissenting groups and individuals. Famously, Ilan Pappe, anti-Zionist Israeli historian and author, is censored across all of Israel and unable to teach at colleges or high schools in the country simply due to his calls for one democratic state with equal rights. Censorship is not a characteristic of democracy.\n\nClaim 5: Hamas started the conflict on October 7th\n\nNo. Ever since 1948, Israel has encroached upon Palestinian territory and escalated violence. Simply put, Hamas and other forms of resistance are a reaction to Israel. With the violent Nakba displacing around 750,000 Palestinians, resistance began. The conflict did not start 2 years ago. Zionist arguments that claim so aim to delegitimize and overlook decades of Israeli acts of violent settler colonialism.",

    "content": "Today's housing market is characterized by a disconnect between buyers and sellers. The root cause? Private equity (PE). Indeed, a select few private equity firms own at least 10% of all U.S apartments. While millions of tenants suffer through rent hikes, poor living conditions, and overall unaffordability, a faceless corporate landlord cannot adequately respond.\n\nPE firms have become increasingly invested in the housing market over the past couple of decades. The strategy for these large firms is simple. Each time an economic shock occurs in the U.S, private equity ramps up its corporate acquisitions of residential areas. In 2008, after the financial crisis, the federal government essentially auctioned off foreclosed single-family homes, leading to private equity firms such as Blackstone buying entire neighborhoods in bulk. Simply put, as recessions and economic downturns force families into defaulting on their mortgages, private equity swoops in to own these homes. Empirically, after similar economic conditions resulting from COVID-19, private equity firms stuck to their patented strategy. Indeed, from the start of the pandemic to January 2022, various investment firms announced nearly $50 billion worth of transactions towards homes. Overall, while economic crisis hits hard for the average citizen, billion-dollar corporations only grow more powerful.\n\nRent spikes, unsafe conditions\n\nThe consequences of consolidation run deep. PE firms are interested in one key principle: profit. As financial gain acts as the leading motivator for the company's decision-making, people are often left in the dust. Independent researchers, activists, and journalists have uncovered how PE's never-ending pursuit of revenue growth comes at the detriment of inhabitants. In Atlanta, poorer communities of color are disproportionately affected by private equity's grasp on single-family residential homes. In predominantly black neighborhoods, PE firms employ a myriad of exploitative tactics to line their pockets. Firms set rental prices to unaffordable levels in an attempt to price tenants out of their own homes. Even worse, private equity often ignores pleas to fix substandard living conditions, health hazards, and faulty maintenance. When living spaces become uninhabitable, either due to affordability or health concerns, residents are clearly forced to leave. PE firms know this to be true. Moreover, they also know that a newly emptied house can be charged for even more on the market, thus increasing profits.\n\nSo, why do these companies not face accountability? That's because private equity is hard to track. With dozens of shell companies, it becomes nearly impossible to trace the funds all the way to the top. By and large, private equity gets away with clear anti-trust violations and monopolistic practices. Furthermore, private equity's actions are often overlooked because blame is placed on other factors, such as scarcity. The issue, however, is that private equity has created artificial scarcity within the housing market. In today's world, politicians constantly associate the housing crisis with a shortage of homes. Yet, reality paints an entirely different picture. In 2023, there was an average of 45.9 vacant homes per homeless person in the U.S. The problem isn't a lack of housing; instead, private equity's artificially inflated prices leave homes vacant.\n\nAlthough private equity dodges accountability, state-level measures in regulating PE's dominant control have bipartisan support on both ends of the aisle. A legislative advocacy group quantifies that at least 32 states have taken action to limit rent fixing and corporate acquisition of homes. By further spreading awareness about private equity's chokehold on the housing market, real legislative solutions have the opportunity to be signed into law. Remember, even when corporate power isolates the working class, there is always a path forward.",

    "content": "When acts of political violence occur, fear is weaponized for gain in the political theater. Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk's assassination on September 10, 2025 at Utah Valley University has since been met with an immediate response. The incident was quickly spun by political leaders into a wider narrative about the rising danger the nation is facing, priming the public for escalated security crackdowns such as the National Guard deployments in Memphis despite the recent decline in the city's crime rate. While the implications of political violence are serious, the act alone is rare. The real danger lies in how isolated events become inflated into justification to expand federal power.\n\nThis response is not unique to the Charlie Kirk case. In March 2025, President Trump reacted to vandalism done by protestors against Tesla by labeling them \"terrorists\" and even suggesting they should be sent to the prisons in El Salvador. This call for justice had little to do with proportionality and much to do with political ties; Trump branded minor property damage on the business of his previous ally, Elon Musk, as a national security emergency. While there was no deployment of military forces, the President's rhetorical escalation reveals how easily our leaders will weaponize an incident to create polarization and a sense of endangerment.\n\nThe pattern is clear, as further revealed by the ICE protests in Los Angeles in June 2025. In response, the Trump administration deployed over 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to the city. This action was taken under federal power and without consulting Gavin Newsom, the governor of California. The justification for this essentially undemocratic action? To quell the \"violence and disorder,\" despite the multiple reports that the protests had been peaceful.\n\nMost recently, in October 2025, Trump authorized the deployment of 300 National Guard troops to Chicago following protests outside an ICE processing center. The protests began after federal agents shot and injured a woman. Being mostly peaceful, protests manifested by holding vigils and marches rather than engaging in violence. Yet, the Trump administration jumped at the opportunity to portray the unrest as a national security crisis and justify sending in federal troops without consulting the governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker. Since then, state officials and civil rights groups have filed lawsuits since the deployment violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts military involvement in domestic law enforcement cases, and the Tenth Amendment, which protects from federal overreach.\n\nThese responses are concerning, not just in their disproportionality but specifically in their selectivity. School shootings only yield thoughts and prayers, not the deployment of troops or extensive policy changes. Research analysts for the Anti-Corruption, Democracy, and Security project at Brookings Institution (Jonathan Katz, Renée Rippberger, and Eric Urby) find that the decision to invoke a military mobilization is driven by the situation's potential for leaders to extract political value from it, rather than the objective severity of the threat. Politicians know that by acting fast and promising safety, the public will reward them; however, the risks of these disproportional responses run deeper in the long-term.\n\nAt its core, normalizing extreme military responses quietly rewrites the social contract to condition the public into accepting military control as part of the democratic routine. The right to protest given to citizens through freedom of speech and assembly in the First Amendment becomes risky, as assembly may draw military forces. The question becomes not how will our leaders respond to crises, but rather will they resist the temptation to exploit the moment for their own gain?",

    "content": "Through the national conversation, stories of missing Israeli hostages or soldiers dominate the narrative. Even when the deaths of these same hostages come as a result of IDF bombs, the coverage is extensive. In contrast, the stories of thousands of Palestinian hostages in Israeli detention centers rarely break into the mainstream. The media has a structural suppression of Palestinian torture and deaths. This year, 13 Palestinians have already died in Israeli custody, and only one of these deaths has attracted any coverage in corporate media. These media ecosystems have enforced selective empathy to hold up the Zionist narrative.\n\nAhmed Saeed Tazaz'a, a twenty-year-old from Jenin, died after just three months of Israeli torture, with zero criminal charges. Despite this harsh reality, no U.S. media outlet spent a second on his death. Across Gaza, the West Bank, and Israel proper, detainees have been subjected to torture, neglected from medical care, deprived of sleep, and subject to violence. The Human Rights Watch documented that when confessions of crimes do occur, they occur after detainees are tortured, stripped, and denied adequate care until they confess. Prison camps have been dedicated to abuse and torture as a result of the system of apartheid.\n\nThe story of Israeli detention has been mortality on a mass scale. Since October 7th, 2023, at least 59 Palestinians have died as a direct result of Israeli detention. Over the decades, around 300 prisoners have died after being illegally detained. As a 2024 UN Human Rights Commission confirmed, the Israeli government deliberately uses \"arbitrary, prolonged, and incommunicado detention,\" in direct violation of international law. Despite all of this, the investment of mainstream media in documenting this is negligible.\n\nWhy does this underreporting occur? In newsrooms that are often funded by Zionist donors, Israeli government statements and briefings receive acceptance, while Palestinian voices are dismissed as unreliable. Beyond this, journalists face severe restrictions in documenting detention facilities, and testimony from detainees is suppressed. Even in the case of Walid Ahmad, a 17-year-old who died in custody does slip into coverage, follow-up, and accountability soon vanish. Compare this to the sustained coverage of Israeli captives held by Hamas; every incident, story, and death is placed on the front page and discussed for months. That discrepancy is intentional and a direct result of a system of oppression.\n\nThis silence has consequences; when there is no public pressure on a genocide, there is no accountability. The U.S. political class, often an arm of Zionist donors, rarely faces questions from the public about Israel's practices in its prisons because the stories remain underground. When a Palestinian dies in custody, it is quietly absorbed in human rights reports or social media, but rarely enters the mainstream. Even when autopsy findings are uncovered that reveal malnutrition, disorders, untreated disease, and muscle wasting, these stories are never known to the general public.\n\nU.S. media institutions, like much of the political structure, are entrenched in colonial frameworks. Through Zionist funding and justification for expansion, stories that align with the narratives from Washington are amplified. When Palestinian suffering is portrayed as unfortunate collateral damage, the people are appeased, and the framework of genocide isn't challenged. Under Israeli narratives of \"self-defense,\" the media can control the moral calculus of the public. Thus, the act of reporting (or not reporting) itself is controlling our politics. Writing about Palestinian deaths challenges the structure of invisibility that controls our government. The stories of Palestinians who die in Israeli custody aren't merely statistical; rather, they are a direct result of systemic erasure. To push back on this narrative in our media is to insist that every death, regardless of nationality, demands justice.",

    "content": "In the early days of October, Morocco erupted in the biggest protests since the Arab Spring. Across Rabat, Casablanca, Marrakech, and Agadir, hundreds of thousands of people have taken to protest under the banner \"GenZ 212,\" demanding a restructure of national priorities, an end to corruption, and accountable democracy.\n\nThese protests come in the context of high inequality in the country. The contrast is stark: at a government level, billions are being funneled into stadiums and infrastructure of the 2030 World Cup. The killing of stray animals under the justification of \"cleaning up\" before the games shows how the state is valuing its public image over lives. Meanwhile, public healthcare and education systems are under neglect. Recently, eight women died during childbirth at Hassan II Hospital in Agadir. Protesters are describing it as \"the conditions in public hospitals are worse than jails.\" This is from a lack of funding. Morocco's doctor density is cited at 7.7 per 10,000, surprisingly low compared to other nations. In terms of the education system, schools are severely resource-limited, especially in more rural areas.\n\nAnd the youth are feeling especially locked out from economic mobility. Youth unemployment is sitting at almost 38%, much higher than in other economies and a sign of crisis, and a struggle to live. Meanwhile, Morocco's corruption and nepotism have been rampant. The Minister of Education boasted about how his son could study abroad in more prestigious education systems, while the youth in Morocco are left at underfunded institutions. The elite's control over government contracts, political parties, and regulations has left much of society alienated. These problems aren't an independent grievance; rather, they tell a story of neglect, where the country only serves the few.\n\nTaking inspiration from the protests in Nepal, the movement merged online. The GenZ 212 Discord, at first with only a few hundred members, exploded in membership to over 150,000 in a few days. This model of organizing modeled on Kathmandu allows real-time messaging and coordination of activism across cities. On September 27th and 28th, protests organized on the Discord server arose in Rabat, Casablanca, Marrakesh, and Agadir and quickly spread across the country. The movement quickly embraced demands for change and calls for Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch to resign. In particular, slogans like \"Nos hôpitaux, pas des stades\" (\"Hospitals, not stadiums\") and \"We are the youth, we are not parasites\" could be heard across the nation.\n\nWhat started as peaceful protests attracted the violent crackdown of security forces. By October 1st, the Moroccan Interior Ministry reported 263 security personnel injured, 23 protestors wounded, 409 arrested, and 142 police vehicles and 20 private cars damaged. These figures from the Moroccan government should still be taken with a grain of salt, as they are trying to maintain legitimacy. Furthermore, the actions of a few protestors who may turn to violence should not take away from the messaging from the general movement, which has been overwhelmingly peaceful, as encouraged by the GenZ 212 Discord.\n\nAs a result of police violence, the protests have turned fatal. In Lqliâa, 3 protestors were shot dead by the authorities. That same night in Oujda, a 19-year-old protester was struck by a police vehicle; now, he is facing one amputated leg and the other threatened by infection. This was not \"self-defense\" by the authorities, video evidence shows police vehicles driving straight through crowds of protesters. Authorities may justify force by citing looting or violence, but the majority of protest violence is reactive, not directive. Overwhelmingly, the struggle is against the elite, not security officers. Across multiple cities, arrests of protestors for exercising their right to free expression are proliferating. Organizations such as the Moroccan Association for Human Rights are condemning the arbitrary arrests as attacks on democracy.\n\nThese protests which are the largest at scale in around a decade show a test of legitimacy for the government. If the state can relegate the movement to \"violent fringe\" or \"rioters,\" as other governments have done, then the movement may die down. But the overwhelmingly approving public response has shown that this is more likely. As long as the youth signal their need for change, the regime must either adapt or fall.",

    "content": "Israel controls everything going in and out of Gaza. To combat Israel's oppressive dominance of Gaza's supplies, a group of activists labeled as the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) decided to sail the Mediterranean Sea in an attempt to deliver food, water, baby formula, crutches, and other materials. Today, members of the non-violent, humanitarian Global Sumud Flotilla are in danger. Indeed, Israel has illegally intercepted more than 40 boats with 500 peaceful activists on board.\n\nIt's no small secret that Israel is starving Gaza. The primary strategy of Israel is to blockade nearly every source of aid from a myriad of different international organizations. Last September, \"15 international aid organisations said Israel was blocking 83 percent of Gaza's aid.\" The excuse is always Hamas. Israel continually claims, with zero evidence, that aid is being stolen and withheld from the Palestinian people by Hamas. Moreover, a report from USAID finds there is no evidence of Hamas systematically looting aid. The denial of aid underscores the need for the Global Sumud Flotilla to exist.\n\nGreta Thunberg, a world-famous climate activist, encapsulates the GSF's mission statement by declaring, \"I'm not scared of Israel. I'm scared of a world that has seemingly lost all sense of humanity.\" While the primary goal is to deliver aid to the ongoing humanitarian corridor, the Global Sumud Flotilla is meant to place international focus on Israel's crimes. So far, they've succeeded. Immediately after news of the Israeli Navy's interception, protests erupted globally in more than nine countries. In Italy, workers are going back on strike. In South Africa, leaders have condemned the blatant breach of international law, calling for the release of South African activists. In Turkey, top officials label Israel's acts as terrorism. Overall, a majority of the international community is united in condemning Israel's actions.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, one ship is still sailing towards the Gaza Strip. Its presence is more than a delivery of humanitarian resistance; it is an act of resistance against a system of genocide. The vessel is a symbol of the refusal to normalize the actions of the Israeli government in Gaza. For the activists on board, the risk of arrest and interception is a small price to pay compared to the suffering of two million Palestinians who are trapped in the largest open-air prison. For the people of Gaza, who have endured bombings, starvation, and the deprivation of basic necessities, the vessels signal that to many around the world, they are not forgotten. Each mile the boat crosses challenges the narrative that Palestinians are isolated. Their struggle resonates far beyond the surveillance towers of the IDF.\n\nUnder international law, the blockade on Gaza has been seen for what it is: a form of collective punishment illegal under the Fourth Geneva Convention. By intercepting a humanitarian flotilla, Israel once again is placing itself at odds with the legal norms of the world. The Global Sumud Flotilla forces the world to see how the Israeli government is at odds with any accountability. No matter if the cargo on the ship is delivered, the flotilla is accomplishing something much larger. As protests are breaking out in Rome, Cape Town, Istanbul, and beyond, the divide between the new generation and their governments is clear. Citizens are demanding compassion for the people of Gaza, raising hope for the new generation of leaders. Thunberg's voice is not just seen as that of an activist, but as a representative for the thoughts of people around the world. The Sumud Flotilla isn't just about Gaza; it's about the principle that no nation should be allowed to starve civilians into submission.\n\n— Samyak Duggirala and Omar Dahabra",

    "content": "America was founded on the principle of separation between church and state. Nearly 250 years later, the lines between the two have become increasingly blurry. Today, American identity has been fused with Christian identity to create a third force: Christian Nationalism. Moreover, Trump has paved the way for Christian Nationalism to sweep across the entire nation and its governance. Perhaps the clearest example comes in the Charlie Kirk Memorial Service held last week in Glendale, Arizona. Along with prominent political figures, members of the Christian faith spoke at Kirk's funeral. However, the issue isn't the mere appearance of religious iconography; the problem arises when our political leaders claim their policies, views, and stances are supported by God. Indeed, the nearly five-hour-long funeral service perfectly encapsulates the principles of Christian Nationalism: a belief in American and Christian superiority. To Christian Nationalists, the two identities are not just connected, but the same.\n\nUnpacking the origins of Christian Nationalism is difficult. The roots of a combined church and state in America date back to colonial times. However, the Founding Fathers crafted the Constitution as a secular document, as evidenced by its lack of religious language. Moreover, the First Amendment guarantees the right to freedom of religion. So, how did the lines become so blurred today? While numerous factors have influenced today's socio-political landscape, a key part was the rise of reactionary televangelists in the 1980s. Indeed, in the 20th century, a myriad of SCOTUS decisions further delineated the separation of church and state, i.e, Engel v. Vitale, Everson v. Board of Education, Lemon v. Kurtzman. As a direct response, the Moral Majority was founded. The story starts with Jerry Falwell, a segregationist educator, dismayed by Supreme Court rulings. His obsession with keeping Christian schools white led to the Moral Majority organization taking flight. Today, Falwell is credited as the father of the Christian Right. In its time, the Moral Majority would preach against LGBTQ rights, abortion, and feminism. Moreover, Falwell's organization had a profound cultural impact on the shift towards conservatism and Reagan's presidency. Although the organization disbanded in the late 80s, its impacts are still felt today. The modern politicization of Christianity emerged due to Falwell. The widespread nature of the Moral Majority introduced the masses to Christian superiority, a tool that Trump has wielded in his toolbox since 2016.\n\nChristian Nationalism is its own cultural framework. Prescribers of Christian Nationalism believe the nation was founded on Judeo-Christian values. As aforementioned, there is little significant evidence to indicate that our nation's governance is founded upon religious values. However, the wider implications of this quintessential Christian Nationalist belief are fascinating. Christian nationalism frames Americans as holy. As a result, anyone who is not a follower of Christ is not American. Even worse, anyone who is not American is not a member of God's chosen people. Fundamentally, Christian Nationalism creates an Us vs. Them mentality. Anyone who does not fit under both identities is otherized. Crucially, the \"other\" is viewed as phenotypically inferior and morally bankrupt. Another dominant belief of Christian Nationalists is their affinity for utilizing the Bible when crafting official legislation and policy. A survey from the Pew Research Center finds that, \"nearly eight-in-ten people who say the U.S. should be a Christian nation also say the Bible should have at least some influence on U.S. laws, including slightly more than half (54%) who say that when the Bible conflicts with the will of the people, the Bible should prevail.\" Unfortunately, the use of the Bible in public policy has already had disastrous effects. For example, Ted Cruz cites the Bible as a key influence on his unequivocal support of Israel. Moreover, a group of conservative lawmakers used Bible passages to argue for the prohibition of gender affirming care for Trans youth in front of the Supreme Court.\n\nChristian Nationalism stems from cultural insecurity. Indeed, back in the 80s, with SCOTUS decisions and the proliferation of hippie progressivism, the Moral Majority was founded. Clearly, Trump has used the same counterculture method to make MAGA and Christian Nationalism mainstream. But for Trump, Christian Nationalism isn't about upholding Christian values as much as it is about upholding power. Evangelical views allow MAGA to imbue fear and hatred into their audience. Evidently, xenophobia propagated by Trump's rhetoric finds its basis in religion. By continually citing the Bible, Trump and his allies gain credibility among their voters despite their policy directly contradicting the Bible's teachings. Religious freedom expert Amanda Tyler, of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, puts it best: \"The 'Christian' in Christian nationalism is more about identity than religion and carries with it assumptions about nativism, white supremacy, authoritarianism, patriarchy, and militarism.\" Indeed, MAGA's Christian Nationalists have twisted the Gospel's word for their own political goals.\n\nMAGA's obsession with Christian Nationalism is the biggest danger to the principle of religious freedom upon which our nation was founded. In America, the identities of one's religion and one's political affiliation must be separate. Yet, Trump and his allies try to blur that line every day in order to marginalize religious minority communities. As a cultural movement, Christian Nationalism is more about political power rather than belief in God. Indeed, the coalition's early roots in the 80s prove that it was never about Christianity. Many devout Christians today vehemently oppose the popularity of the movement as well, condemning its blasphemous methods of twisting God's words into political campaign soundbites. Overall, MAGA's adoption of Christian Nationalism is a threat to everyone.",

    "content": "Earlier this month, Google quietly handed over a student activist's Gmail data to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Their crime? Supporting Palestine. The subpoena wasn't signed by a judge, required zero probable cause, and gave the student no space to challenge it in court. By the time he was notified, he had already returned to his country. In the space of the Trump administration, big tech corporations have become a tool of the deportation machine.\n\nThe mechanics, or lack thereof, matter. Unlike in the past, ICE has stopped using warrants. Now, their strategy is using administrative subpoenas, tools to bypass judicial oversight completely. These subpoenas are invoked by companies like Google and Meta hundreds of times per year, and are almost accepted. Unlike warrants from a judge, they require zero proof of any criminal activity. Instead, they hinge on broad statutory authority that allows ICE officials to request information \"relating to the privilege of any person to enter or reside in the United States.\" This vagueness has become the legal foundation for thousands of deportations.\n\nThis expansion of federal power is dangerous. In past years, Silicon Valley tended to posture as \"defenders of the 1st amendment\" as Facebook, Twitter, and Google tended to praise their refusals to comply with subpoenas they saw as overbroad. But in the wake of criticism of political dissent, especially around Palestine, these companies are scared of higher scrutiny, and their stance has shifted. These companies have turned into surveillance intermediates, collecting information from the people and serving them to the state. Their presence is shaping the absence of allowed dissent.\n\nThe previously described event by Google is far from isolated. ICE has continually used Palantir as a middleman to fill up government databases with private data, creating millions of profiles for migrants and activists. ICE has greatly increased its relationship with the private sector, purchasing location data from brokers to track immigrants, even far from the border. These practices form a model for repression: government power that is supported by private sector compliance, for fear or for profit.\n\nAt a personal level, students like Amandla Thomas-Johnson and Momodou Taal from Cornell were targeted for their activism against the genocide in Gaza. Their activism, which should be recognized as protected speech in any democratic society, was enough justification for mass surveillance. As a result of their protest, subpoenas were sent to Google and Meta, and their lives were placed under the government's eyes. Subpoenas have turned into a tool that is easily used and conveniently requires zero notification of the surveilled party. The opacity is intentional.\n\nThis digital repression is by design. States will not resort to overt censorship that is likely to be criticized when private firms can supply the same, if not better, effect. This surveillance chills speech without inviting much criticism. Knowing that a simple Instagram post would trigger a subpoena from ICE is enough to keep immigrant protestors silent. The line between democracy and authoritarianism has been greatly blurred in practice.\n\nIt's not just here. U.S. surveillance is exported abroad, arming authoritarian governments from the Gulf to Southeast Asia to track activists. The same firms that are supplying ICE with Gmail data are licensing facial recognition software to regimes that kill dissidents. What happens to student activists in Ithaca today happens to protestors in Beijing tomorrow.\n\nPersonal data has become the material of a new system, with indifference to democratic obligations. Big Tech is not a neutral power. It is a willing partner in a state system that thrives on silence. In a world where dissent is recorded and handed over at the click of a button, companies like Google and Meta are fueling the fire.",

    "content": "For over a decade, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has maintained a significant influence on India's politics. Crucially, the BJP hides behind hypernationalist rhetoric and Hindu exceptionalism, creating an inherently right-wing nation in the process. However, nestled along the southern tip of the country is the state of Kerala, a beautiful coastal area home to many diverse subcultures and religions. To Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Kerala represents a threat. To leftists across the globe, Kerala represents hope. Simply put, Kerala, similar to its synthesis of various cultures, has adopted a mix of socialist and communist practices to ameliorate the conditions of its people. Although the state is not without its problems, it offers a clear model of what modern-day socialism can achieve.\n\nCommunism has always been rooted in the concept of class struggle. In Kerala, it's no different. Senior economist Aditya Balasubramanian at the Australian National University posits that the post-war famine in India directly led to the rise of socialist policies. In the colonial era, India was reliant on British exports for food. In the midst of World War II, due to various conflicts and battles, access became limited. Specifically, in the southern area of Travancore, rice became increasingly harder to come by. As a result, Travancore had to get out of a famine quickly before mass starvation occurred. However, leaders in Travancore, such as the autocratic C.P. Ramaswamy Aiyar, failed in delivering sustained action against the famine. Moreover, the ruling class in Travancore continually undermined the gravity of the situation. Overall, the mismanagement of food resources allowed the communist uprising to thrive and secure a legitimate place in politics. Ever since then, Travancore's ideological connection between India's resources and communist theory has spread like wildfire across all of Kerala. With this momentum, communists have won major general elections, secured influence amongst the people, and instituted beneficial policies surrounding a myriad of different sectors. Generally speaking, Kerala is unified as a single state with a strong emphasis on caring for its people. With public funding towards education, healthcare, and sustainability, Kerala has been able to yield great results. Indeed, Kerala heralds a 100 percent primary education enrollment rate, higher by significant margins over any other state in the country. Moreover, significant progress has been made towards universal healthcare in the past ten years. A study conducted by the International Journal for Equity in Health highlights, \"overall increase in the share of public facilities for both outpatient care and hospitalization is indicative of the enhanced trust among the people at large of the public healthcare delivery system in Kerala.\" Moreover, infant mortality rates have gone down exponentially as \"Kerala leads the country in the highest number of institutional births, and no child suffers from malnutrition.\"\n\nThe current party in power, the BJP, has dedicated considerable resources towards its goal of eliminating Kerala's communism. However, time and time again, they have failed. In 2014 and 2019, the BJP spent over 4.5 million dollars (Rs 40 crore) in Lok Sabha elections. They won zero seats. However, in the 2024 election, the BJP's pandering efforts to significant Christian populations in the state proved effective as the BJP picked up its first seat in Kerala's history. Now more than ever, is the time to support Kerala's valiant efforts in opposing BJP nationalism. The BJP's platforms and staunch resistance to Kerala's model are disturbing signs. Indeed, the socialist practices adopted by Kerala have proven effective, yet the BJP still aims to dismantle successful policies in favor of profit.\n\nFor leftists everywhere, Kerala is a prime example of modern-day socialism at its best. The region's unique history has lent itself well to classic leftist theory and the implementation of Marxist policies. Although the state is not perfect, it has made massive strides towards important sectors such as education and healthcare, and remains economically successful in comparison to other states across the sub-continent. However, Kerala's way of life is wholly at risk from the larger, nationalist BJP party. Yet, the people of Kerala are resilient, determined, and generous. Together, Kerala exemplifies a government that puts its people first.",

    "content": "Donald Trump's decision to call antifa a \"domestic terror organization\" is the most recent example in a larger campaign to criminalize protest. However, despite what this may sound like, this doesn't have any basis in law and is not the same as declaring it a terrorist organization. The term \"domestic terror organization\" has no basis in U.S. law, but that has not stopped Trump from using it for his rhetoric. In 2020, he made identical claims during the Black Lives Matter protests. In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, Trump is using his death to stretch the definition of terrorism to cover a range of dissent from the left. The real danger isn't the label itself, but how it can be weaponized against anyone who opposes his agenda.\n\nThis government strategy for creating \"domestic terror\" laws is only done to suit the administration's interests. After the January 6th insurrection, there were calls for new statutes to target such violent extremists, but in those cases, Trump did the opposite and issued a blanket pardon for all rioters, including those who attacked the Capitol. Instead, domestic terrorism prosecutions are being used as a form of political policing, making it clear that dissent is a threat to state order.\n\nThe vagueness of what \"antifa\" means makes the potential for abuse worse. Antifa is not a formal organization; rather, it is a political tendency for antifascism, meaning that nearly any leftist protest could fall under the term. That looseness is what allows Trump to generalize all protestors, and suggest that the funders of any left-wing organizations should be investigated for \"financing terrorism.\" The statements are less about specific criminal behavior and more about creating a culture where the opposition can be targeted.\n\nEven if legal action isn't taken, financial repression could be used. Treasury sanctions powers could apply to protesters, cutting activists off from banking, housing, and jobs. Citizens who simply voice criticism of Trump's policies could be grouped into the same bubble as terror supporters and see a lifetime devoid of opportunity. If protest organizers are equated with ISIS extremists, then it is possible to choke movements from starting, from financial isolation, even if no arrests occur.\n\nEven where the law does not directly support repression, the chilling effect is real. As The Intercept noted, ordinary citizens may simply stay home rather than risk being miscast as terrorists. This effect is amplified by Attorney General Pam Bondi's flirtation with prosecuting \"hate speech,\" a category so broad it could encompass any criticism of the administration. Though she backtracked, the message was clear: protest could be punishable. That message resonates with Trump's base, but it also creates a climate of fear that drains the vitality from democratic life.\n\nWhat is at stake here isn't just the right to free speech through marching in the street, but the ability for the people to be able to contest power. If any protest is equivalent to terrorism, then democracy itself is hollowed out. Trump, throughout his term, has viewed dissent more as hostility against his movement, rather than civic participation, and has shown he is willing to take drastic measures to prevent any condemnation. His antifa decree is just a single example of this worldview.",

    "content": "Each year, the United Nations (UN) convenes in New York to discuss the state of global affairs. For years, the UN General Assembly has led to monumental decisions and impactful changes that have shaped the trajectory of history. Indeed, the partition of Palestine that led to the Nakba was decided at the UN General Assembly. Following in history's footsteps, today's meeting is paramount to analyze and break down to predict the future of our entire globe. Now more than ever, there is a lot to talk about. For starters, Trump delivered a speech filled with \"America First\" rhetoric, endless quips, and degrading remarks towards the UN itself. In his hour-long ramblings, he began by criticizing the failing teleprompter and ended with vague boastfulness of America's place in international politics. Indeed, a common theme throughout Trump's remarks was the incessant focus on undermining the efficacy of the UN while propping up America's own efforts. It's no small secret that Trump is putting in a heavy bid for the Nobel Peace Prize. Thus, yesterday's international speech was merely Trump rattling off his recent resumé. He falsely claimed that, as the UN failed, he stepped up to end seven \"unendable\" wars. Moreover, he criticized other countries for not adhering to restrictive immigration policies. In typical outlandish Trump fashion, he claimed, \"I'm really good at this stuff; your countries are going to hell.\" However, Trump's rhetoric is not only a laughing matter; it signals a potentially dangerous spiral in the international community. The U.S is, in fact, a model for other countries. Trump's sweeping authoritarian moves and his continued encouragement of nations around the world to implement similar policies could have disastrous consequences in the fight against global fascism.\n\nNext, we turn our attention towards the African leaders of the world delivering powerful speeches in the international community. Guinea-Bissau, The Gambia, Ethiopia, Botswana, and South Sudan all came together with one central message: Africa is not heard. A more equitable global world order is not only necessary but integral to the health of the world. Specifically, the UN Security Council, a group of member states with increased influence, does not have enough representation of Africa. The group has five permanent members: France, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Although ten additional members are elected at each general assembly with two-year terms, there are no African countries that are permanent members. That's crucial because UN Security Council members have the power to veto legislation with just one vote. Unequivocally, Africa and the Global South need more representation and influence in international relations.\n\nPossibly the largest announcement out of the UN General Assembly was the support of Palestine as an independent state. It started with Netanyahu's extremist speech in which many members simply left the room. Indeed, the Prime Minister was delivering remarks to a largely empty audience. However, his fiery sentiments cannot be ignored as he called for increased annexation efforts. Largely, Netanyahu feels threatened by his waning control. Western countries like the U.K., France, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Andorra, and Belgium have all recognized Palestine as a state. Crucially, 4 out of 5 UN Security Council members have now formally recognized a Palestinian State. Remember, although these countries will never fully rid their guilty conscience, recognition is the first step. International legitimacy grants the Palestinian people a voice to be heard, officially. Indeed, Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), represents resilience. Despite President Trump denying a visa to Mr. Abbas, through virtual remarks, he powerfully dictates, \"Palestine Is Ours\".\n\nThe 80th UN General Assembly is an important one. As global liberation movements pick up steam, authoritarian countries seek more control, and massive humanitarian crises go unheard, the UN can become a beacon of hope or a systemic failure to global citizens. As we dive deeper into an uncertain future, one thing is clear: reform within the UN is necessary for global equity.",

    "content": "On September 8, 2025, the Supreme Court handed Donald Trump a political gift while committing a constitutional betrayal against the very people they swore to protect. The 6-3 decision in Perdomo v. Noem lifted restrictions on immigration raids in LA by reversing an order from a lower court. This reversal granted federal agents the ability to detain people based solely on race, ethnicity, occupation, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, or being in particular locations (e.g. bus stop, car wash, agricultural type, work places). Simply put, the ruling gives the green light for state-sanctioned racial profiling, a decision that threatens due process, the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, and the Constitution's promise of equal protection under the law for all.\n\nBut this ruling didn't happen out of the blue; its foundations were built in rhetoric, particularly in speeches by President Trump, that slowly legitimized the fear and perception that certain people are dangerous. When unchecked, this language becomes normalized and seeps into institutions and legal interpretations, eventually turning into policy.\n\nTrump has wielded language as a political weapon since the start of his 2015 campaign to his current second presidential term. In 2015, Trump called Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and warned Americans about their blame over the \"invasions\" at the border. In 2018, he further dehumanizes immigrants by tweeting about them \"infesting\" the U.S. More recently, in 2024, Trump referred to immigrants as \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" This language by such a powerful authority figure conditions the public to associate Latino identity with criminality and inferiority.\n\nHowever, this goes beyond just words. Trump's language has shown to embolden others to openly express their own prejudices, a phenomenon labeled as the \"Trump Effect\". In 2018, a White nationalist killed 23 people in El Paso while invoking Trump's message. Violence influenced by Trump's rhetoric isn't new; according to the FBI, counties across the United States that hosted rallies for Trump in 2016 saw a 226 percent surge in hate crimes.\n\nPolitical analyst and senior writer for CNN Politics Zachary Wolf explains it best; while immigration enforcement has always existed, what characterizes this new era of policy is the racism it is built on and encourages, becoming persecution rather than enforcement. When the President frames marginalized groups as problems, then policies are created to eliminate the problems. With the Supreme Court's most recent ruling, those words turn into legal precedent that allows government overreach.",

    "content": "For what seems all too common in this administration, \"national security\" is being used as an excuse to expand state power and repress individual rights. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has backed legislation introduced by Representative Brian Mast giving Rubio unilateral power to revoke U.S. passports for citizens for providing \"support\" to terrorism. On paper, this may not seem like such a bad idea, and may seem like a good idea to ensure domestic security. In reality, the excuse of \"supporting terrorism\" has been used to punish political speech. This sentiment isn't hypothetical. Earlier this year, Rubio stripped Turkish doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk of her visa based on an op-ed that she wrote criticizing Israel. As a federal court ruled, the only act that Öztürk committed was one of free expression.\n\nThe legislation accomplishes little in practice against actual terrorists, since those convicted of terrorism would already be facing prison, and those awaiting trial are denied bail, but it would hand dangerous amounts of authority to the Zionist secretary of state. Ultimately, the legislation provides for thought policing at the authority of one individual: journalists who cover sensitive conflicts could see revoked passports for reporting facts unfavorable to the Trump administration. For example, in 2023, Senator Cotton demanded a Justice Department investigation into journalists from the Associated Press, CNN, the NYT, and Reuters over photos taken of the genocide in Gaza, clear examples of attacks on press freedom.\n\nThe danger of Mast's legislation comes from how vague the term \"material support\" has become. The Supreme Court's 2010 ruling in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project has upheld the term meaning that even advising a group on peaceful conflict resolution could be considered material support. Beyond foreign policy, immigration authorities have applied the statute to victims, like branding a Salvadoran woman who was kidnapped and forced into domestic servitude as a \"terrorist support.\" Zionist groups such as the Anti-Defamation League and the Brandeis Center have argued that any Pro-Palestinian voices, such as chapters of the Students for Justice in Palestine provide \"material support\" for Hamas due to their pro-Palestinian activism, an argument that opens the door to stripping passports from student organizers.\n\nThe historical precedent between this action is mixed. In Aptheker v. Secretary of State, the court ruled that blanket bans on Communist Party members from obtaining passports were unconstitutional attacks on free association under the First Amendment. However, more recent Supreme Court decisions have become increasingly partisan and based on the goals of the administration; Rubio's proposal is likely to be supported by a 6-3 conservative majority Supreme Court, given past decisions.\n\nBeyond silencing Palestinian voices, the implications for democracy are stark. Such a law blurs the line between dissent and disloyalty, and democracy and dictatorship. Academically, it discourages international research and reporting, as students and journalists would likely self-censor to protect their identity. Socially, it would likely cause even greater stigmatization of activist communities, and reinforce the idea that critique of Israel is tantamount to treason. Legally, it creates the precedent for future administrations, Republican or Democrat, to weaponize foreign policy on ideological opponents.\n\nThe American passport has long symbolized freedom and the basic rights to democracy. To make rights contingent on political obedience makes said rights meaningless. Rubio's supported legislation should be understood not just for what it is, but as a part of a broader authoritarian drift, one that makes it more of a state with less freedom for its citizens.",

    "content": "The IDF's military strategy has become increasingly offensive, with attacks on both Yemen and Qatar recently. As Israel ramps up its siege on Gaza, it plans to dismantle perceived opposition to its genocide. Two weeks ago, Israel killed Yemeni Prime Minister Ahmed al-Rahawi along with thirty-five others. Just two days ago, Qatar fell victim to strikes on \"Hamas leaders\" in its country. In typical Israeli fashion, a Qatari official was killed as collateral damage, all while Hamas leaders survived. The world has stayed silent. Israel has a repeated history of subjecting its Middle Eastern neighbors to large acts of violence. Indeed, it is a go-to tactic in the IDF's playbook called the Dohiya doctrine. The strategy calls for large-scale destruction of civilian infrastructure, disproportionate force, and deliberate targeting of civilians. General Gadi Eisenkot, former chief of General Staff, coined the term in 2008 while referring back to the 2006 Lebanon War. \"What happened in the Dahiya quarter of Beirut in 2006 will happen in every village from which Israel is fired on… We will apply disproportionate force on it (village) and cause great damage and destruction there. From our standpoint, these are not civilian villages, they are military bases… This is not a recommendation. This is a plan. And it has been approved.\" Unfortunately, Eisenkot's policy has been widely adopted by Israel. We saw it in Yemen. We saw it in Qatar. We will continue to see it until Israel faces justice at the hands of international bodies. Crucially, the Dohiya doctrine is forbidden by law. Yet, no one cares.\n\nIn the coming days, weeks, and years, Qatar will feel betrayed. Indeed, the Middle East's central model of operating in foreign policy has been broken. For decades, the Gulf States prioritized appeasing the U.S because they perceived a reward for their willingness to help. However, as Israel struck Qatar, irreparable damage was done to Qatar's view of the West. \"This has real repercussions for the relationship,\" said Patrick Theros, a former US ambassador to Qatar. Israel acts without regard for its consequences, as evident through 75 years of history. Today, the nation's dangerous political rhetoric, coupled with its even more damaging actions, cannot go overlooked. Qatar, in spite of its endless efforts to align with Western interests, finds itself at a tipping point. Regarding the U.S, Qatar has played a useful role as a mediator between Hamas and Israel, as well as with the U.S and the Taliban. However, Qatar is now less likely to continue its part in mediation with Netanyahu bombing the country at his own will. A deterioration of Qatari-U.S. relations spells disaster for regional stability. Indeed, Qatari officials have already withdrawn from the ceasefire negotiations. However, that's exactly what Israel wants. Indeed, the country realizes its relentless assaults only create cycles of violence, whether it is Hamas or Houthis. The strategy is simple: if Israel fuels the flames of terrorist groups through escalation, then they have an excuse to continue disproportionate attacks. Palestine, Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen are all examples of this strategy coming to light. Let's quickly imagine a scenario. A man threatens violence against your family, and then carries it out. Now, you are the last surviving member of your bloodline. Would you or would you not try your hardest to get revenge? After repeated incidents, most would fight back. In the past 75 years of history, those who have fought back have been labeled terrorists. The \"intifada\" has become synonymous with terrorism instead of its actual meaning: uprising. Indeed, Israel and the West have created entire terrorist groups in their endless pursuit of power. A famous example is in Syria, where the frequent killings of political leaders opened the door for Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to fight against Syria's government forces. Yet, adding fuel to the fire is necessary to keep up appearances of right vs. wrong. If militant groups like Hamas continue, Israel has a pass to commit any atrocity they want. Unfortunately, the past two years have only proved this strategy effective. No country has truly been willing to stand up against Israel's impenetrable force as a country heavily backed by U.S technology and military. The key piece of the puzzle goes back to the Dohiya doctrine, where it specifically calls for \"disproportionate force\". Terrorists are outmatched by a well-funded, oppressive military with nuclear weapons at its disposal. Israel knows that. Indeed, it allows them to continue their offensive strategy with confidence, creating a cycle of violence.\n\nSo, what's the end goal? In the process, Netanyahu plans to create a \"Greater Israel\". The continued existence of terrorist attacks only validates his dream. That's because Israel thrives on violence. The state has the means to reduce other nations' civilian infrastructure, army populations, and military bases to rubble. Yet, it needs an excuse to do so. Uprising gives exactly that: an exigence. Essentially, it's a meticulously designed trap.\n\nIsrael, in and of itself, is a terrorist state. Through its abuse of international law, horrific acts of ethnic cleansing, and violent military strategy, that much is clear. With each murdered civilian, the state only grows stronger. Remember, targeting of civilians is built into the IDF as a central approach to creating another reason to attack and annex more territory. Israel will continue to violate the sovereignty of other nations and, in the process, perpetuate more violence in the long run. Unfortunately, the only way to end the cycle is to hold Israel accountable for its actions in the hands of international law, as arrest warrants for Netanyahu go completely disregarded. Yet, as Arab nations come together, hope is not lost. France and the U.K. have taken the first step by calling for recognition of Palestinian sovereignty. Although more substantial policy action is needed, global condemnation of Israel's actions is increasing, signaling a positive progression. In the final analysis, at the global level, Israel must not be allowed to continue its current plan of action.",

    "content": "The House of Representatives recently passed an amendment banning any \"politically motivated boycott of Israel, making Israel the only country that has this title. In the United States, you can boycott other states, other allies, but not a country committing a genocide. These acts, beyond justifying genocide in Gaza, are another step in the Trump administration's attacks on the First Amendment. Republicans are aware of this and have pushed these laws in disingenuous ways. In this instance, Rep. Boebert slipped the measure into the Pentagon budget, allowing for little debate and barring contractors that engage in boycotts from any federal contracts. This provision shields Israel from any accountability for human rights abuses by penalizing one of the few tools available to society outside of the region: boycotting. Regardless of one's stance on Middle Eastern politics, this should alarm anyone who emphasizes the importance of freedom of speech.\n\nThe constitutional stakes of this action, and the effects that anti-BDS (boycott, divest, and sanctions) laws have, are enormous. For centuries, political boycotts have been a form of American tradition and resistance, from the Montgomery bus boycott to campaigns against the Vietnam War, to protests against apartheid in South Africa. In NAACP v. Caliborne Hardware, it has been made clear that nonviolent protests for social change are protected under our First Amendment. Our federal government's financial and criminal penalties against boycotts of Israel show that our Congress and state legislatures are not engaging in entural constitutional policymaking, but outright authoritarian discrimination against viewpoints. Anti-BDS laws constitute an example of textbook punishment against people for their political opinions.\n\nDespite these obvious violations against our rights, brought up by groups such as the ACLU, lawmakers have pressed forward. Ideologically motivated courts have followed. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld in Arkansas Times v. Waldrip that federal contracts are now required to certify that they would not boycott Israel. In the highest level of our judicial system, federal courts are now creating new exceptions that undercut our principles of freedom of speech. In the past, earlier courts in Kansas and Arizona have struck down similar laws, recognizing them for what they are, unconstitutional restraints on political speech. However, the political climate since Trump's victory has changed the Overton window, and this seems to also apply to the courts. This is only made worse by the Supreme Court being the most ideologically based that it ever has been.\n\nBeyond legal measures, the political implications of these measures are clear. 38 states already have anti-BDS legislation enacted, with many of these laws requiring companies, individuals, and teachers to sign a loyalty pledge to Israel as a condition for doing their job. This compelled speech should be treated as it is, antithetical to the idea of a free country. These laws not only silence any voices speaking up for Palestinian rights, but also set a precedent for other social movements, whether it be climate activists pressing for fossil fuel divestment or labor union organizers pushing for employment rights.\n\nThe danger is not confined to Israel-Palestine politics. By codifying the suppression of disfavored political boycotts, the government opens the door to silencing dissent across the spectrum. Legal scholars have warned, as noted by Haaretz, that if this framework is accepted, nothing would prevent lawmakers from penalizing boycotts of gun manufacturers, fossil fuel companies, or corporations that bankroll political campaigns. What begins as an attack on BDS metastasizes into an architecture of repression.\n\nAt its heart, the anti-BDS campaign is about narrowing the boundaries of acceptable dissent. When Rep. Boebert can slip a sweeping restriction on political expression into the Pentagon budget without meaningful debate, it signals a dangerous erosion of democratic norms. As Defending Rights & Dissent policy director Chip Gibbons has emphasized, the government has no business punishing citizens for their political beliefs. That principle is not left-wing or right-wing — it is the cornerstone of a constitutional democracy. To abandon it in the service of shielding a foreign government from criticism is to betray the very freedoms lawmakers claim to defend.",

    "content": "Recent protests have sparked public outrage as the streets of Kathmandu, Nepal's capital city, are filled with social unrest. Corruption is the root cause. The youth of Nepal are overwhelmingly fed up with a government that consistently overlooks their needs. Today's protests are nothing new. In fact, civil disobedience has slowly built up over the past few years as a reaction to the country's growing inequality. The tipping point was finally reached a few days ago as parliament decided to ban nearly 26 forms of social media, preventing the free dissemination of information. Almost immediately, Gen-Z protesters took to the streets to advocate against a fundamental violation of rights. The governmental response has been tragic. In multiple clashes, a total of 22 protestors have been killed by police. Fortunately, the ban has been withdrawn, and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has resigned. Although the Nepalese people have taken a great first step, rooting out corruption will still take prolonged effort.\n\nIntervention only breeds dependency, debt, and corruption. If a state is given funding from a major world power, the hegemon expects a return on investment in the shape of political influence and soft power. For example, investments in healthcare, architecture, education, and governance are heralded as a blessing, but in reality, corruption ensues. Simply put, the government is now more focused on appealing to its \"generous\" benefactor instead of its own people, thus incentivizing deceit. Nepal is a prime example. Inequality has only skyrocketed in the country, despite economic growth on paper. Wealth remains unjustly concentrated in the hands of a privileged few. While it is easy to blame Nepal's predicament solely on corrupt leaders, it is vital to recognize that the root of this injustice lies with donor countries. By channeling vast resources directly to a select elite, these countries perpetuate a cycle of inequality and suffering for ordinary Nepalis. Crucially, for major world powers, developing countries are like pawns on the chessboard—simple pieces to move in order to progress the game of hegemony. For example, the $500 million MCC Program does not offer altruistic help to Nepalese citizens; it is meant to serve as a wedge against expanding Chinese influence. In fact, many in Nepal protested against its implementation due to growing distrust of Western aid and its perceived invisible political strings. Their concerns are not entirely unfounded. Indeed, a study from the University of Cambridge found that economic growth from aid was limited. Moreover, as US policy-making is subject to drastic swings in opposite directions, receivers of foreign investment are the ones negatively affected. For example, recent cuts to USAID push millions into irrecoverable situations. However, the next time a Democrat president restores these programs, the country is back to square one. The issue is inconsistency. The only guarantee for a country like Nepal is an uncertain economic landscape prone to disaster. As these nations build up over-reliance on the U.S, any cuts to funding can prove to be catastrophic at the worst times. History has revealed the fatal flaws in Western governance, as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have both fallen victim to the same pervasive trap in recent years.\n\nNepal, with its South Asian contemporaries, has suffered at the hands of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). In Kathmandu, more harm is done than good by NGOs. In a particularly disturbing example, nineteen Nepalese children were discovered in abusive living conditions in an NGO \"orphanage\". Corrupt organizations have empirically flourished under the millions of dollars in foreign aid granted to Nepal. What's worse is that most NGO's vie with one another for aid from their Western donor, decreasing their actual effectiveness in ameliorating the conditions of the Nepalese people. Investigative Journalists Rachel Browne and Alia Dharssi write, \"NGOs fail to work together at the border, which would be more effective in helping more people.\" Overall, the system is flawed to its core.\n\nAlthough the changing political landscape of today offers hope, the underlying issue is much deeper than the current face of government. Structural corruption runs deep. It starts with Western donations and ends with the endless suffering of the Nepalese people. The motivations for the West are simple: money, power, and influence. So long as aid continues, so will corruption. Crucially, that's by design of the global world leaders. If third-world countries remain dependent on larger ones, then the power dynamic of neocolonialism is kept in place. In Nepal, rooting out endemic corruption is not as simple as overthrowing a deceitful government. Unfortunately, the issue is embedded deep within US foreign policy and its deceptive strategies.",

    "content": "The media controls perception. In a fast-paced digital world, the news we consume influences our perspective on nearly every aspect of policy. However, the journalism industry follows a heavily corporatized structure—a system that quells dissent, ruins employees' livelihoods, exacerbates biases, and forces journalists to fight an uphill battle. Today, tech giants dominate the media landscape after decades of little to no opposition. Monopolization has ravaged the industry as only five major companies control the production and dissemination of information.\n\nBroadly, media monopolies are a threat to American democracy because they eliminate local sources of news. While local newspapers still exist today, they're dying at the hands of big tech monoliths. Since 2004, over 250,000 jobs in journalism have been driven out due to the expeditious rise in privatization. The problem arises when consolidation leads to a political slant. In a 2019 study, researchers analyzed conglomerate ownership of smaller journals, finding corporate takeover made stations slant more to the right politically. The explanation is clear: less journals mean less differing opinions. A decrease in the circulation of political ideas means our democracy becomes weaker.\n\nThe concentration of media ownership reduces the diversity of viewpoints and can even suppress opinions that go against the interests of the parent company. The clearest example is when lobbying groups or private interests cloud reporting by filling in bias. Recently, coverage on the Palestinian struggle by mainstream media has been corrupted to focus on a less condemning lens of Israel. It is clear that the choice of words used by major media outlets purposefully deny and delegitimize the Palestinian cause. A 2011 study from the Glasgow Media Group found that there are fundamental differences in the way that Israeli perspectives are treated compared to Palestinian ones. The BBC featured over twice as many Israelis over Palestinian perspectives. Words like 'atrocity', 'brutal murder', 'mass murder', 'savage cold blooded killing', 'lynching' and 'slaughter' were used about Israeli deaths but not Palestinian.\n\nMoreover, misinformation after the October 7th attacks ran rampant as well. Media coverage rarely focused on the history of conflict, encroachments of Palestinian territory, or widespread abuses suffered by Gaza before 2023. Important context was missing. Moreover, the Zionist propaganda model was adopted by western outlets. When Israel, with no evidence, claimed that Hamas was using civilians as \"human meat shields\", the mainstream media ran with it. However, the paradigm is shifting in today's modern landscape where many can take to social media and simply witness Israel's abuses. The mainstream media's propaganda has become less effective as a result.\n\nMoreover, independent journalists can fight back. From Upton Sinclair to Ta-Nahesi Coates, members of the press have historically sought to expose the ruling class for unjust business dealings. Writers today ought to follow in the footsteps of our predecessors, this time exposing the malpractice in our own industry. The use of independent journalism is a strong weapon in the arsenal of aspiring journalists today, yet it is consistently underutilized. By leveraging today's digital landscape, writers can directly hold media monopolies accountable. Publishing individual content combats the oppressive control of big media by offering readers fresh perspectives, shifting their preference to supporting smaller journalism. Independent journalism is the key to fixing the many ailments of mainstream media.",

    "content": "In the West, sanctions are often framed as a more humane alternative to armed conflict. But looking at their research, they are anything but peaceful. Findings recently published in The Lancet reveal that U.S. and EU sanctions have caused an estimated 38 million deaths since 1970, far exceeding the casualties from conventional war. Far from being simply \"instruments of diplomacy,\" sanctions function as weapons against human life.\n\nTake sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s. As a result of U.S. sanctions, the population severely lacked access to medicine, clean water, and electricity, causing hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths from malnutrition. When asked about the reported deaths, U.S. Secretary of State Albright replied that \"the price is worth it.\" This statement, while cruel when put in clear words, symbolises the moral bankruptcy of our sanctions policy.\n\nMore recently, Venezuela paints a clearer example. The Center for Economic and Policy Research found that as a result of U.S. financial sanctions, healthcare systems collapsed, and life-saving imports were blocked. As a result, more than 40,000 Venezuelans died in a single year. This is the result of a system that directly chokes access to life-saving items.\n\nThis cruelty of sanctions has long been present on Capitol Hill. A U.S. State Department memo from 1960, describing our sanctions on Cuba, explained that the sanctions aimed to \"bring about hunger, desperation and overthrow of government.\" Hunger has never been an \"unintended consequence,\" but rather an objective to destabilize countries. Sanctions have become a form of modern warfare to kill silently.\n\nSanctions are especially deadly because of their control over the economy. The dominance of the USD and the Euro over international payment systems gives Washington and Brussels the capacity to exclude entire countries from global trade. This monopoly ensures that sanctions have the largest impact in the Global South, where dependence on Western financial systems is the deepest. Basic technology, such as cloud computing, is weaponized to punish dissenting nations.\n\nThis moral failure doesn't even come with political success. Sanctions only succeed in changing state behavior less than 20 percent of the time. Instead, sanctions fuel black markets, devastate citizens, and entrench authoritarian dominance. In countries like Iran, where sanctions target financial and oil sectors, only the wealthy can find ways to get around sanctions, while ordinary civilians face shortages of life-saving medications and rising inflation\n\nIf policymakers in the West claim to care about \"democracy and human rights,\" sanctions expose how hypocritical these statements are. These acts of collective punishment should be treated as indistinguishable from collective punishment discussed in the Geneva Conventions. The policy doesn't affect morals, but 21st-century imperialism.\n\nIf we care about opportunities to live in the South, the solution lies in creating trade agreements, investing in technological infrastructure to decrease Western reliance, and creating independent payment systems. China shows this is possible, the development of a software named CIPS as a rival to the Western-backed SWIFT system shows that a multipolar system may be starting.\n\nUltimately, our moral imperative is clear. We should not stand up for sanctions that kill more people every year than mobs, no matter how much their language is delivered. To defend human rights around the world, dismantling the oppressive regime of sanctions must be the start.",

    "content": "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services serves as one of, if not the most important departments in all of America. Through its management and operation of thirteen separate agencies, including the FDA, CDC, and NIH, the HHS is responsible for the well-being of all Americans through public health programs, healthcare services, and research support. Trump's questionable decision in February to appoint former political adversary Robert F Kennedy Jr as Secretary of the HHS has led to even more questionable policies from the department, most of which directly go against all established research and evidence. RFK's policies have been characterized by leading scientists and doctors in the medical field as incompetent, predicated on bias and false information, and wildly harmful to the American public. The future of US health policy appears bleak, and it seems that yet again, citizens will be the one paying the price: not in dollars and cents, but in years off their life.\n\nRFK has long been an ardent supporter of anti-vaccine discourse, evidenced by his multiple headlining antics and quotes in the past few years. His founding of the organization Children's Health Defense in 2016, which famously advocates conspiracy theories against vaccines; his controversial quotes about vaccines, where he has compared childhood vaccine programs to Nazi death camps; and his most famous crusade against vaccines, claiming they cause autism, despite all research pointing to the contrary.\n\nAs Secretary of the HHS, he has sought to further his goal of eradicating vaccines: he fired the entire CDC immunization committee and supplanted it with members more in line with his agenda, slashed hundreds millions in funding for mRNA vaccines and openly supported criticism of said vaccines, and continually ignores recommendations for safe administration of immunizers. His recent press conference in the Senate was at best worrisome: he made numerous erroneous statements about vaccines, could not name important statistics regarding COVID, failed to provide a reasonable justification for his gutting of the CDC board, and devolved into accusing opposing senators of accepting bribes from pharmaceutical companies, without providing evidence.\n\nThis saga comes amid the first measles outbreak in years after enough of the population did not receive measles vaccines, which was largely influenced from misinformation coming from the White House. Thousands of cases, the highest reported in 33 years, stemmed from RFK's actions and advocacies to reject science and medical professional advice. The current trend of health policy under Trump looks as if it will only put more American lives at risk in the future through weakening the medical care system and spreading erroneous information about medicine. In current times, where America is deeply polarized and cannot agree on much, all citizens should be confident in their government to protect and maintain the health of the nation, but RFK's policies threaten even that. More must be done to counteract his agenda in order to save thousands of American lives.",

    "content": "Jeremy Corbyn's launch of a new party to represent disillusioned left-wing voters, titled 'Your Party,' arrives at a time when immigration and economic issues are at the forefront of British society. The context of his message is stark when compared to Keir Starmer's Labour, which scrapped the Conservatives' plan to send migrants to Rwanda but embraced a 'tough' outlook on immigration. Indeed, they pledged to end hotels for asylum seekers and increase enforcement for migrants seeking jobs. Police action against far-right protests against migrant accommodations is spreading, and police-escorted standoffs have become normalized among the administration. Internationally, human rights groups are warning of attacks on free speech after the government proscribed Palestine Action as a 'terrorist group,' making support of them the same as supporting groups like ISIS, because they committed non-violent acts of vandalism. In this climate of left-wing policy not being fully implemented by the Labour government, Corbyn represents a growing interest among voters, particularly in defending human rights against punitive migration policies and in ending the social hardship that many voters face.\n\nIn previous years, immigration policy from the Labour Party has oscillated, but party elites have long been fearful of anti-immigration right-wing backlash. As a result, Starmer did try to appease left-wing voters by promising a 'rules-based asylum system,' but to appease right-wing businesses elites, the government has promised to end hotels housing refugees with no place to stay. In practice, the policy on immigration has not shifted significantly since Sunak's Conservative administration.\n\nIn Jacobin, Corbyn illustrates his popular message that caused more than 700,000 British citizens to register for the party in under a week, making it the biggest political party by number of members. For context, the Labour Party(as the second biggest) has 309,000. In the piece, Corbyn explains what many left-wing Brits are feeling, saying that Labour is 'paving the way for fascism' with their anti-migrant policy: publicly posting detention footage, causing a cultural stigma against those seeking asylum, and creating a culture centered around fear. Refugees who are exercising their legal right to flee conflict and contribute to the economy are being attacked. Specifically, he frames his new party as the vehicle to resist the 'slippery slope' where parties once considered centrists incrementally start to normalize authoritarian policy. In essence, when more 'moderate' parties start to embrace more extreme policy, the ideas of 'right and left' get skewed.\n\nIn the British 'majoritarian system' of voting, a dominant party can quickly entrench its frames of politics, especially on security issues, across executive, legislative, and policing related practices. This comes in the context of the UK's post-Brexit media, with its fixation on punitive gestures in the press. A government can talk like a labor importer but legislate like a border hawk: the inconsistency is the problem for voters. Under Labour, voters feel that the system has led to no strategy for integration, stalled systems, and a weaker economy. Politically, Labour's shift to the right on border control has fractured its voting control, opening space not only for Reform on the right, but also for hundreds of thousands of voters to switch to the new Corbyn party on the left, especially in urban and university settings where civil liberties concerns are more likely to be important to voters. Economically, as well, migrants are significant contributors to the British economy, and many voters feel disenfranchised with the policy of less migration post-Brexit, feeling that it has not allowed for substantial potential GDP growth.\n\nWhile Britain may be a 'democracy,' elements of criminalizing protest and increasing police presence in immigrant communities have started to migrate in a political system that, on paper, should allow for free expression. Corbyn's warning in the Jacobin article is less about imminent change in the UK, but about the incremental borrowing of illiberal tools worldwide that is seeping into British politics. Corbyn's policy is both a critique and a prediction: that a humane, pro-work asylum policy can be electorally viable if someone speaks to the economic situation without scaremongering. Labour still has the chance to pivot: caring more about processing, integration, and growth rather than policing and attacks on human rights. But if it continues in its borrowed far-right strategies, it risks validating a world that makes everyone feel less free.",

    "content": "For experienced MD Elisabeth Potter, it was a typical day of surgeries stacked on top of one another. Nothing out of the ordinary until Potter received a phone call from United Healthcare at the halfway point in the midst of surgery. All operations seized. United asked Potter for information about the patient on the operating table. Shortly after, the doctor took to social media to immediately spread the story of what occurred. The thesis of her video, which has garnered over 6 million views on TikTok, was simple: insurers have too much power over the public's health. The evidence is overwhelmingly on her side as insurers time and time again put profit over lives. In a sea of various healthcare providers, United Healthcare is the biggest offender. Indeed, Potter has continually posted more and more anecdotes online of United outright denying healthcare to those who need it most. As a direct result of her videos, Potter's surgery center in Austin, Texas, has been blacklisted from any insurance networks. Crucially, her work entails breast reconstruction and innovative plastic surgery for cancer patients. Yet, as private companies continue to make the daily lives of U.S citizens harder in a broken healthcare system, the government does little to help. New analysis from yesterday found that Texas tax cuts for millionaires come as a direct tradeoff with health insurance for 4.7 million people.\n\nWith the press of a stamp, United Healthcare has directly killed millions of people. The underlying reason? New processes within the company utilize AI to automatically deny or approve insurance claims. For United specifically, after the implementation of AI systems, denial rates have reached 33 percent. That's because the board of directors and investors pulling the strings behind the company line their pockets even further with every denial. A new report revealed claims are often auto-denied, then approved much later after multiple rounds of costly appeals. In the process of filing an appeal, fighting the denial, and getting lifesaving care, huge amounts of money are lost for the everyday consumer on top of mounting prices for medical bills. Basic access to healthcare has become completely unaffordable. Moreover, public opinion is shifting as well. The University of Chicago conducted a poll post-killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. When adults were asked about the death, 7 in 10 adults said that denials for health care coverage by insurance companies played a \"moderate role\" in Thompson's passing.\n\nDuring the G.W Bush Administration, conservatives pushed to privatize Medicare. So, the Medicare Advantage program was born, giving private insurers control over the bodies of our aging population. Indeed, for those above 65+, the private plan has become widely adopted across the nation. As a result of providers being private, for-profit companies, complaints have started to rise about unnecessary denials and unhealthy business practices. Moreover, as we see in nearly every effort of privatization, taxpayers pay higher costs. Traditional, public Medicare is much less expensive, while Medicare Advantage runs prices higher and draws from taxpayer funds to operate. So why do so many opt for Medicare Advantage if it is an objectively worse option? The answer is deception. The program promises an easier-to-understand, simple-to-navigate alternative to traditional Medicare that is appealing to older audiences. In reality, private companies make costs higher for everyone under the guise of \"convenience\". The private playbook is working. Nearly 54% of Medicare-eligible citizens are choosing Medicare Advantage instead.\n\nPrivate companies do not belong in healthcare. From Big Pharma crowding out small innovators, CVS utilizing vertical integration, and insurance companies employing unethical business practices, it is certain that profits are put over lives in our capitalist system. While healthcare quality deteriorates, CEOs and investors get richer off suffering. Consumers not getting the care they need is a desirable situation for providers. Crippling debt for daily insulin turned into stock increases. Worst of all, death rakes in millions of dollars for companies. The system is broken, and corruption at every level has become the norm.",

    "content": "In the United States of America, capitalist monopolies have been mostly unregulated, especially in contemporary times. While the merits of this capitalist system can be debated, when this comes at the cost of lives, as in the case of healthcare retailers. Over the past few years, CVS has imposed drastic \"clawback fees\" of over $500 million dollars, in a predatory campaign aimed at debilitating their competitor, Rite Aid, in the Pacific Northwest before then acquiring the struggling company. Throughout the years, CVS has had a policy of devastating the financials of their competitors, only to later consolidate market control over their company, leading to price hikes for consumers. Vertical integration, in this sense, is used to prey upon independent and smaller growing pharmacies to institutionalize their dominance and cement profit.\n\nBeyond this instance, CVS has had a legacy of systemic abuses. An Federal Trade Commission report in 2024 highlighted that CVS, alongside Express Scripts and OptumRx, fueled price inflation for speciality drugs(often by hundreds to thousands of percent) by using preferential treatment of affiliated pharmacies and rebate-driven formularies(which reduce the upfront cost of medications, but often come with manipulative strings attached.) A later FTC investigation found that from 2017 to 2022, these Pharmacy Benefit Managers(third-parties that manage prescription drug benefits for health insurance companies) amassed billions in profit by exploiting their monopoly over supply chains.\n\nThese practices are not isolated. In September of 2024, the FTC filed a separate administrative complaint, showing evidence that CVS and its peelers rigged the insulin market by favoring high-rebate, expensive productions, excluding affordable options, and thus shifting high monetary costs onto diabetics that are vulnerable and in need of the life-saving drug. In January of this year, another report confirmed the pattern: Pharmacy Benefit Managers(PBMs) like CVS impose dramatic mark-ups across life-saving therapies: from cancer drugs to heart disease, while squeezing out independent pharmacies that challenge their philosophy and dramatically inflating consumer costs.\n\nLuckily, some regulation is being successful in challenging CVS's practices. Early this year, a federal court required the company to fully comply with the FTC's investigative interest into their business practices. Meanwhile, a federal court just last week ordered CVS to pay almost $300 million in damages for Medicare fraud(stemming from their overcharges on consumers.) The award, which was originally $95 million, was tripled due to the court's findings of reckless disregard. But while this is certainly a step in the right direction, it doesn't address the fundamental problems with PBMs being able to artificially inflate prices at the cost of lives.\n\nIn other positive news, while the pharmaceutical lobby does still have a chokehold on most politicians, some resistance is growing. In Arkansas, Governor Sanders led an initiative to ban PBMs such as UnitedHealth, CVS, and Cigna from owning pharmacies, a step in the right direction of ending the vertical integration that allows these companies to negotiating with themselves, prioritize profits over life-saving access, and blocking out any \"fairer\" competition. Despite a preliminary injunction blocking the implementation of the law, this could set the precedent for similar reforms across the nation. In fact, in Louisiana, Attorney General Merrill filed three lawsuits against CVS for mass-text obeying, unfair competition, and abusive under-imbursement of independent pharmacies in a suit that alleges that CVS leveraged their relationship with their patients to lobby against proposed legislative PBM reforms, violations trust and privacy laws.\n\nIn understanding why CVS, or any PBM with significant influence behaves this way, a basic understanding that most businesses in a capitalist system rely on vertical integration is required. CVS has an empire controlling retail pharmacies, insurances (Aetna), and its PBM via Catermark, a structure that allows both conflicts of interest and unchecked power to award interest, set unfair prices, and direct patients to its own outlets. CVS, as the world's second-largest health ace company has gotten to its position through Medicare fraud, deceptive pricing, and contributing to the opioid crisis, reflecting a systemic privatization of profit over care.\n\nVictories against PBMs like the aforementioned settlements for deceptive practices are telling, but such settlements only bar specific switches that harm patients; but the suits don't directly address the structural incentive of profit against consumer interests. CVS Health epitomizes the corruption of healthcare of capitalism: pursuit of profit, vertical integration, and corruption have caused a system that punishes the vulnerable and corrodes our public health.\n\nWhat does this mosaic of malfeasance reveal? From left-of-center vantage points, CVS Health epitomizes the corruption of healthcare by capitalism's consolidation: vertical integration, opacity, and entitlement have yielded a system that punishes the vulnerable, undermines local pharmacies, and corrodes public health.",

    "content": "Nearly a quarter of the U.S. population is covered by a health plan all year that doesn't ensure affordable access to care. The problem? Big Pharmaceutical companies raise prices on consumers all while operating under the guise of faux-innovation. Indeed, pharmaceuticals act as monopolies. The term \"Big Pharma\" isn't thrown around online forums, political debates, courtrooms, and news segments without obvious reason. Big Pharmaceutical companies hold a hand around the neck of small pharma and squeeze their grasp ever so tightly as to ensure no innovation ever occurs. As the pockets of monopolized pharmaceuticals get fatter and wider, the pockets of the consumers, the American public, are drained. To defend their unlawful practices, Pharmaceutical giants try to justify their immense earnings by pouring it all directly towards \"innovation\". Despite how it may seem on paper, the truth is clear: large-scale private companies are the same entities killing any new chance of scientific advancement in favor of greed. A systemic problem exists within healthcare and big pharma is the root of the issue.\n\nThe myth that large pharmaceutical companies pay for their expensive clinical trials and thus rightfully earn the intellectual property and the profits that come with it has been thoroughly debunked. Large pharmaceutical companies have been shifting away from \"Research and Development\" and more into \"Search and Development\" allowing the majority of early drug development research to be done by publicly funded research institutes and universities. Essentially, Big pharma leads consumers to believe that high drug prices are a result of the high cost of testing, layered on top of R&D costs. In reality, inflated costs are just an excuse to accumulate wealth.\n\nThe problem with the narrative pharmaceutical companies try to push to the American public is that the primary cause of drug price inflation is research and development. If the publicly funded portions of the drug development process are subtracted from the total cost of drug development, the net cost private companies face to bring a fully tested drug to the market decreases nearly 10-fold from what company estimates report. Corruption and greed are both evident as the public has to deal with artificially inflated prices. For example, in recent years, there has been an extensive need for new antibiotics; despite this, there has been a decrease in new antibiotics being developed and tested by the private sector. Pharmaceutical companies are downsizing and eliminating their antibiotic discovery programs, citing \"barriers limiting profitability\" as an excuse. In their own words, companies care more about profit than health.\n\nCrucially, there must be a change in the common consensus that Big Pharma is the only driver of innovation in the medical field. Startup companies can not only hold their own when it comes to development but also outperform corporations when it comes to bringing life-changing drugs to market. Precisely, in a case study looking at novel drug approvals from 2013 - 2022, the results found that in spite of large R&D operations, the world's largest pharmaceutical companies do not efficiently convert R&D spending on products developed in-house, particularly compared with emerging, smaller companies. On the other hand, the largest companies maximize earnings by both charging higher prices as well as acquiring additional intellectual property through licensing deals or acquisitions. This is crucial; empirically, the strategies of smaller companies are much more efficient and beneficial to the individual consumer.\n\nBy prioritizing equitable access in both the production and consumption aspects of the process, life-saving medications will finally be distributed properly. A small-scale redistribution of resources at the government's disposal could ultimately lead to a compromise solution in which smaller companies develop new and innovative biomedical technology while bigger companies distribute it. On the contrary, the status quo proves to be a far worse situation in which monopolized pharmaceuticals control every level of the medical process from innovation to distribution.",

    "content": "Since Trump's victory in the 2024 elections, international students looking to further their education have faced an increasingly threatening U.S. immigration system. The State Department has issued guidance to students stating that they now require applicants to make all their social media profiles public, even on platforms that no longer exist, such as Vine and Google+. Despite having clear privacy concerns for many minors and/or people who don't want to be contacted by people they don't know on social media, this requirement is nearly impossible to meet. To apply, you must now provide your username for up to 20 different social media services, with the government scanning posts for any information that would show your \"hostility towards the United States.\" Despite this \"hostility\" clearly being defined as anything the Trump administration doesn't agree with, as evidenced by their attacks on student protests, this mandate is a clear attack on free speech, especially for students who are fleeing authoritarian regimes only to be forced to reveal their personal details to the White House.\n\nThis policy is part of a larger campaign by the current administration to initiate what they call \"expanded screening and vetting.\" In reality, it has been a crackdown on dissent. State Department cables show that immigration officers are instructed to scrutinize social media accounts for evidence of contrary political leanings and any criticism of American institutions, a deliberate attack on our First Amendment right to criticize the government. This system, while clearly authoritarian, disproportionately targets students from Muslim-majority countries, where institutions such as the military are more commonly criticized online, for issues such as their funding of the Israeli genocide in Gaza.\n\nThe effect of these actions has been devastating. An analysis from the Cato Institute found that F-1 student visa denial rates, even before Trump took office, jumped to a record 41 percent in 2024, up from only 15 percent in 2014. With Trump's actions, this number is only expected to dramatically rise. Hundreds of thousands of students looking to contribute to our economy will be turned away, and American universities will be deprived of billions. Universities that especially rely on international enrollment, such as small private institutions without substantial federal grants, could be forced to cut programs or even cease to exist.\n\nBeyond just looking at the statistics, the toll on individual families is striking. The Guardian spoke with students from Iran who have been blocked by the new restrictions, describing their ambitions of a bright academic future overnight. \"It felt like my dreams had collapsed,\" one student said, showing the same sense of betrayal that hundreds of students who were admitted to top programs feel, but are left stranded abroad in their home countries because of the restrictions. For many students who made it to our country and are enrolled in universities, they feel forced to self-censor online and shy away from campus activism, fearing that their visas could be revoked over something as minimal as an anti-Trump tweet.\n\nAlready, universities are feeling the impacts of Trump's policy. The Department of Homeland Security proposed capping the validity of student visas at only four years, even though programs such as Ph.D. programs and research degrees last longer. This shift in policy, combined with visa cancellations and delays, has left institutions such as Arizona State University with tens of millions in losses as students are stranded abroad before classes begin.\n\nThe consequences aren't just specific to education. International students contribute in countless ways to our nation: tens of billions to the U.S. economy, innovation in science and research, and creating new businesses that make our nation internationally competitive. By making our visa process unnecessarily authoritarian and difficult, the United States risks ceding its global leadership in education, not just to allies like Canada and the United Kingdom, where policies remain more welcoming, but to rivals like China, where investment in education is only increasing.",

    "content": "On August 27, 2025, a shooter opened fire at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, killing two children aged 8 and 10 and injuring nearly twenty more, before turning the gun on himself and dying by suicide. Both weapons used in the attack were purchased legally, which is massively concerning for gun safety. When not even schools inside churches are safe, it's a reminder of the harsh reality that America continues to accept.\n\nLater, authorities found a manifesto that threatened political leaders and contained racist, antisemitic, and anti-Catholic language. Indicating severe mental instability, the shooter had also written the names of previous mass shooters on magazines. However, mental health issues are insufficient to explain why such large-scale massacres continue to occur in the US. Every nation faces mental health issues, but the United States stands out for having easy access to automatic, lethal firearms that can turn personal issues into mass violence. Other nations use strict regulations to restrict that possibility, but the United States does not, and children die because of it.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey responded with strength, rejecting the idea that this moment called only for sympathy. \"These kids were literally praying,\" he said. \"Don't just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now.\" Frey called for a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, explaining that these firearms are designed for military use, not civilian life. He also made a point to keep the focus on gun access, speaking out against attempts to redirect blame toward the shooter's gender identity. Frey argued that scapegoating marginalized communities misses the real issue, being the weapons themselves.\n\nGovernor Tim Walz is thinking of calling a special session to discuss proposed gun control legislation. However, reform is uncertain due to Minnesota's divided legislature. This is a prime example of the all too familiar cycle: outrage, discussion, partisan deadlock, and then silence until the next atrocity. Even when mass shootings shake the public, lawmakers are rarely affected. The victims are reduced to statistics, and nothing changes. This national issue is exemplified by the Minneapolis tragedy. Dozens of families have been traumatized, two children have been killed, and the general public is left wondering how such violence could occur in a church. Despite repeated evidence of risk, the incident raises questions about whether lawmakers are at all willing to take action on gun regulation.",

    "content": "On August 25th, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order directing the Justice Department to start pressing criminal charges for those who burn the U.S. flag, a vow of \"one year in jail\" for those who do so, and deportation consequences for non-citizens. Although a clear violation of the First Amendment (as the Supreme Court has decided), the political balance of the court has meant that it is doubtful whether the order will be overturned.\n\nIn Texas v. Johnson (1989), the court held that burning the flag as an act of political protest is protected as symbolic speech, and that state and federal governments could not prosecute such political messaging. After all, our nation was founded on the right to free speech against our government. This decision, upheld a year later in United States v. Eichman has been essential to protecting our right to free speech. Trump's order threatens to strike down decades of precedent and convert political expression into a criminal offense. With the current 6-3 conservative precedent in the Supreme Court, precedent is likely to be rewritten for the administration's goals.\n\nLooking at the text of the order shows Trump's intentions. It directs immigration agencies to deport non-citizens(including lawful residents) and pursue convictions for \"anti-American sentiment.\" Although the administration has defended its actions as constitutional by saying that it is through \"well-established, non-speech-targeting statutes,\" Trump's own unconditional statements of \"If you burn a flag, you get one year in jail,\" show that the intention is just to punish the message he disagrees with, not to implicate other crimes when they coincide with crimes.\n\nThe immediate enforcement of this order showed the goals of the administration. Two days after the order passed, an Army veteran burned a flag in front of the White House. He was detained, but the pretext from prosecutors was that he was \"lighting a fire on federal parkland(keep in mind, he was in front of the White House).\" This is unprecedented, and protestors in the past have burned American flags in front of the White House, without facing prosecution. The route of the administration seems to be to prosecute for any possible minute relationship, to have plausible deniability. The White House situates its prosecution in property damage or riot statutes, but only does so against speech with underlying messages that they disagree with.\n\nAdvocates of the executive order point to previous free-speech exceptions, such as \"imminent lawless action\" under Brandenburg v. Ohio or \"fighting words\" under Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire. However, neither is a comfortable fit for flag burning as a political protest, as courts have only found this exception to be met by direct violent confrontation.\n\nAlthough he hasn't acted on it until recently, Trump has long planned to ban flag discretion. In 2016, he said that flag burners should \"lose citizenship or [spend] a year in jail.\" In 2019, he backed a proposed constitutional amendment by Sens. Daines and Cramer to nationally criminalize flag burning. This year was when he finally took action\n\nAt the moment, many states still have flag-desecration statutes in their books, book they are unenforceable after the court rulings in Johnson and Eichman. In fact, forty of such laws are still in state codes across the nation. For example, both the Confederate and American flags are \"illegal\" to burn in Florida. One Supreme Court ruling could suddenly make this enforceable. The executive order stands to legitimize these statutes and allows for greater potential for enforcement.\n\nLike many of Trump's executive orders, civil liberty groups have quickly responded. For example, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression has reiterated that flag burning is constitutionally protected, and a lawsuit from groups like the ACLU is likely ot come. As legal commentators have stressed, even if arrests rise, successful prosecutions will be hard unless the government can prove harm wholly apart from the constitutional expression. This has been seen before, when Congress passed the Flag Protection Act in 1989, the immediate result was more flag burnings as a form of protest and swift invalidation by the Supreme Court, not deterrence. It remains yet to be seen if the same will occur, as more people are being prosecuted for protesting, and the Supreme Court is more aligned with the president.\n\nThe stakes of attacks on free speech are larger than the symbol. The flag in American society has stood for protected protest, even when scorned by dissent. The First Amendment was meant not to shield popular speech, but to protect the unpopular. No matter how patriotic you are, the greatest form of patriotism would be to uphold the rule of law outlined in the Constitution.",

    "content": "When Donald Trump cuts the ribbon in his new golf course in Scotland, or receives another private jet from the Qatari government, the imagery may seem familiar. However, those personal endeavors have become side shows. Nearly 3/4ths of Trump's net worth, around 11.6 billion out of his 16 billion, comes not from his hotels, licensing deals, or merchandise but from his cryptocurrency holdings. The U.S. presidency has been used to deregulate and promote the very industry in which he is one of the largest stakeholders.\n\nIn 2019, Trump's opinion on Bitcoin and other currencies was very different, stating that Bitcoin was \"not money\" and \"highly volatile and based on thin air.\" He further warned that such assets could help to facilitate illegal markets. Today, Trump has transformed into the most influential president for deregulating currencies, signing bills such as the GENIUS Act, and planning to create a governmental \"Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.\" As a result of his actions and his promotion of meme coins such as $TRUMP, he has earned billions.\n\nJust days after Trump signed his \"Big Beautiful Bill\" into law, cutting health care and food support for millions of low-income Americans, and raising the deficit by four trillion under the guise of \"the American people\", he immediately pushed bills to make it easier to pad his own net worth by allowing for lower federal supervision of his own crypto schemes. Policy is no longer about the public good; rather, it has been about Trump's Coinbase account.\n\nAfter coming to the presidency in January, Trump launched his $TRUMP meme coin on Solana, with his own companies retaining an astonishing 80% of all tokens(for context, Bitcoin's owner owns around 5%.) After Trump promoted the coin, he gained hundreds of millions, while retail investors lost millions as Trump-affiliated organizations profited from their staggering fees. Later, World Liberty Financial, controlled by Donald Trump Jr, unveiled a \"USD1\" coin backed by both foreign capital and the United States government. As a result, anonymous overseas investors influenced a president whose personal wealth is connected directly to the coin. The more the President's wealth depends on these anonymous investors around the world with financial agendas unknown to the American people, the greater the risk of foreign influence. Recently, at a dinner for the largest $TRUMP coin holders at Mar-a-Lago, these same foreign investors were seen communicating with officials in the Trump administration. Exerting influence on our government through pure wealth has never been easier. When drafting the GENIUS Act, the White House leaned heavily on the same language provided by industry lobbyists seen at the dinner, outsourcing legislation to crypto venture capitalists to enrich Trump's portfolio.\n\nThe excuse from the administration has been laughable. Press secretary Karolina Leavitt dismissed allegations of Trump's conflict-of-interests as \"fake news,\" stating that Trump simply had a vision to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.' But far from democratizing finance and giving retail traders an opportunity, Trump's policies reward billionaires with industry connections while leading to billions in losses for the everyday investor. Because $TRUMP coin(and meme coins in general) are so volatile, his promotion of the coin presented a lot of danger. As a result of their investment, almost 750,000 ordinary Americans lost money, totaling billions in reductions for these traders.\n\nTrump's crypto presidency isn't one of the American people, but exploitation for political goals. By turning policy into a means of turning his portfolio green, Trump has both exposed our people to financial instability and shown how foreign manipulation is shaping our government.",

    "content": "As the UN General Assembly draws closer, the push to recognize Israel's war crimes on an international scale grows. However, the U.S. virulently opposes any anti-Israel sentiment and will go to extreme lengths to protect its proxy in the Middle East. Thus, in order to silence a genocide, U.S Secretary of State Marco Rubio denied and revoked visas for members of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian Authority (PA). The scope of today's actions falls within a larger trend of delegitimizing the Palestinian state in international bodies. For far too long, Palestine has been forcefully absent from discussions surrounding its sovereignty, independence, and fundamental right of its peoples to exist. The state department falsely qualified its decision, stating, \"The Trump administration has been clear: it is in our national security interests to hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with their commitments, and for undermining the prospects for peace.\" The U.S. perpetually pushes out propaganda, citing \"Hamas\" at every turn. Unfortunately, denying Palestinian authority is nothing new for the West.\n\nDating back to the 1940s, peace negotiations have always lacked Palestinian representation. Indeed, in the century-long conflict, \"mediation gatekeeping\" has only escalated. Israel's conception is possibly the clearest example of Palestine's exclusion. The U.N. General Assembly on November 29th, 1947, decided to split the Palestinian land into equal parts representing both the Jewish and Arab populations. However, after the 1948 Nakba, Palestinians were left in disarray. Instead of a single Palestinian authority speaking up for itself in armistice talks, Arab states around the area and the UN Security Council were the only ones allowed at the table. Crucially, when the armistice negotiations were over, there was no coherent Palestinian state. Instead, Israel negotiated directly with Egypt and Jordan to slowly seize more land away from the Palestinian-owned areas.\n\nUnfortunately, the trend of others speaking on Palestine's behalf continued on in the 1970s as well. Heading into a new era, the U.S. became the primary mediator of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Crucially, that meant that the U.S controlled the narrative on the issue. Taking advantage of their powerful position, the U.S continually labeled the PLO as a terrorist organization despite various efforts from PLO leaders to gain international legitimacy. The US's repeated attacks on the PLO's credibility rendered the organization useless. The overall strategy was a continuation of decades prior: engage with Israel and Arab neighbors for diplomacy, not Palestine itself.\n\nFinally, in 1991, Palestine gained a voice with the Oslo agreement. However, the recognition of the Palestinian government was conditional on the PLO being in power. Shortly after, once Hamas won the parliamentary elections, Israel (along with others) went back to pretending that Palestine was not an individual nation. The flawed Oslo agreement serves as a reference point for all negotiations today. Critically, Palestine was not recognized as a state during the diplomatic talks of the past two decades.\n\nUltimately, jumping back into the present, the U.S is employing the same strategy on Palestine that the West has relentlessly stuck to over decades. Yet, in international waters, the tide is turning. At the upcoming UN General Assembly, France plans to recognize a Palestinian State. The U.S is poised and determined to make sure that no such step will be taken. If Palestine continues to suffer from a lack of legitimacy, then it becomes easier for the international community to overlook Israel's crimes. So, the U.S does everything in its power, as proven historically, to make sure that Palestine does not get a voice. The Trump administration is just the latest example of a decades-old foreign policy maneuver.",

    "content": "As the sun rises on a desolate landscape, families wake up early to head towards the mines. While scavenging for pieces of cobalt to survive on, children, teenagers, mothers, and fathers all reminisce of a time when the soil they stand on belonged to them. Instead, the homes they used to inhabit are reduced to rubble, and every inch of land is ripped apart for the chance to recover a single speck of cobalt. A first-hand account of a Congolese teenager details, \"At 13, I followed the young men from my village to the mines. I wanted to earn some money to buy myself a pair of trousers and change my life, just like all the other young people in the village. When I had been working there for three years, several diggers were crushed in a rockfall.\" Cobalt is a curse on the Congo and a blessing for the West.\n\nThe West is focused on an energy transition through \"sustainable\" practices. The implementation of green policies, investment, and production results in an increase in demand for the materials necessary to facilitate such an ambitious process. Cobalt is one of those materials. Unfortunately, DR Congo draws in the entire world's attention as 73.0% of global cobalt output is attributed to the country. As a result of the rich natural resources, the nation suffers at the hands of neo-colonial powers. However, the exploitation of the Congo is not a new development.\n\nThe Belgian Congo is one of history's most egregious violations of human rights. In the late 19th Century, European powers drew imaginary lines across the heart of Africa, controlling land they had never set foot on. Under the influence of King Leopold II, Belgium obtained the \"international legitimacy\" to own the Congo's abundant forests. As Belgium forced the Congolese people into slavery, the area was renamed \"Congo Free State\". The following chaos could only be described in one word: genocide. Back then, instead of cobalt, it was rubber. Instead of a battery for electric vehicles, it was tires for early models of cars. In the process of shipping these materials out west, nearly 10 million inhabitants of the Congo had died in poor working conditions. As King Leopold II passed away, the only difference was a change in the name of the colony; by and large, the mass exploitation continued. Even with slavery abolished, Belgium simply adapted by paying the Congolese low wages. However, after decades of protest and international scrutiny, Belgium finally let go of its chokehold on the colony. June 30th, 1960, is the DR Congo's independence day. Nearly 70 years later, there isn't much to celebrate.\n\nThe DR Congo's sensitive geopolitical arena complicates the mining industry even further. Clashes between various armed groups have become the norm for over 30 years now. Currently, fighting between the M23, a Rwandan-backed rebel group, and the Congolese security forces is rapidly escalating each day. Armed conflicts in the eastern DRC are distant from private mining enterprises, yet the displacement of Congolese families puts them directly in the crossfire of a decades-long clash. Nearly 7 million people are displaced, civilian attacks run rampant, and prisoners of war remain in inhumane living conditions. Meanwhile, mining projects are continually renewed and expanded further, resulting in even worse outcomes for the conflict.\n\nRockslides and collapses are the key characteristics of DRC mines. In essentially a system of modern-day slavery, children are expected to work 12 hours a day. Crucially, safety equipment is unheard of here. Think Global Health writes, \"An estimated 500,000 to 2 million people in DRC rely on mining activities for employment.\" Millions of people spend long work hours isolated in tunnels that could collapse at any given moment. In the process of finding renewability, the Congo became a public health safety hazard to the millions of inhabitants. What's worse is that many families simply go to the mines to scour for scraps in the hopes of finding a piece of cobalt to trade in. Yet, the families that have lived on this land for generations can no longer afford to stay. Cobalt mining not only affects physical health, but also the environmental health of surrounding areas. Nearby dump sites contaminate the soil, making it virtually uninhabitable for families. The positive feedback loop is a toxic cycle in which Congolese citizens have no choice but to leave a dire situation for an even more unfortunate one. The only two options are work and stay, risking death from various diseases and unsafe conditions, or leave the area, risking the possibility of walking into an armed conflict.\n\nThe mainstream media has stayed silent on the Congo. Simply put, investigating and reporting on the Congo is a difficult task. Obviously, companies in the cobalt mining business do not willingly disclose their well-documented crimes. Moreover, the fruits of exploitative labor are too good to spoil. Exposing companies like Apple for providing batteries to our phones using unethical methods is an issue that news outlets cannot mention. Blissful ignorance is a better path for mainstream media. It's clear, staying silent on the Congo is staying complicit. However, even when reporting is done on the Congo, it's typically framed in a racially biased outlook. Minerals are mentioned in relation to M23's inconsequential profits. However, seldom discussed is the mass exploitation conducted by foreign corporations in China, North America, and Europe.\n\nWhile the world looks to reduce its overall carbon footprint, the Global South becomes a sacrifice zone. The Congo is only one example of a larger trend expected to escalate much further. According to a report done by the UN, the global extraction of raw materials is expected to increase by 60% by 2060. Ironically, extraction processes contribute to 60% of global heating impacts and 40% of air pollution impacts. \"Green Capitalism\" simply cannot save us from negative environmental impacts. The advent of electric vehicles across China, North America, and Europe cannot seek to offset the detrimental effects in the very process of creating the \"green\" mode of transportation. In the near future, the Global South will fall victim to even worse conditions. Structurally, the exploitative system of Green Capitalism will inevitably result in neo-colonialist principles reinstated. Congo is the first sacrifice. More are on their way.\n\nThe latest colonial-induced suffering of the Congolese people comes in the form of \"sustainability\". Cobalt mining, as leading expert Siddarth Kara puts it, is \"the slave farm perfected\". The Congolese work through rough conditions and unlivable wages simply because there's no other choice. It is a perfect system of exploitation. Moreover, the world has stayed silent on modern-day slavery, and a structurally violent system that keeps it in check. Putting profits over lives is actively harming the environment and the Global South, despite what corporations would lead you to believe. \"Green Capitalism\" is not a viable solution.",

    "content": "This August, lawmakers in Texas passed a mid-decade congressional map, giving Texas republicans 5 more seats in the House of Representatives for the upcoming 2026 elections. Usually, maps are redrawn every 10 years after a population census is taken to determine districts. However, following calls from Trump, the GOP decided to gerrymander as an attempt to grab all the power they can muster before the 2026 elections. The constitutionality of such actions is shady at best, as the new maps reduce the voting power of minorities, which is directly in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court is unlikely to make any decisions in order not to anger Trump and the GOP.\n\nIn mid-August, Democratic members of the Texas House staged a two-week walkout to deny Republicans the quorum needed to advance their mid-decade redistricting bill, stating that the redistricting was \"a blatant violation of the constitution and a grab for power\". GOP leaders reacted aggressively. The House Speaker authorized civil arrest warrants for absent Democrats, and, in some cases, state police were tasked with locating and returning them. Despite the walkout, Republicans eventually secured enough votes to pass the map. But the walkout succeeded in drawing national attention to the controversy and delaying the process, while also serving as a symbolic protest against the GOP's grab for power.\n\nJust 2 days ago, on August 23rd, California Governor Gavin Newsom passed Proposition 50, known formally as the Use of Legislative Congressional Redistricting Map Amendment. This amendment is headed to voters on November 4, via a special statewide election and redraws California districts, giving democrats 5 more seats in the House. This amendment is clearly a direct retaliation against the gerrymandering by Governor Greg Abbot in Texas. Mike McGuire, California's senate president, stated, \"Today was more than drawing lines on a map. It was about drawing a line in the sand to stop Texas, to stop Donald Trump from rigging this election\". This bold gambit is boosting Newsom's national profile as a fighter against Trump.\n\nThe gerrymandering battle happening between Texas and California for the upcoming 2026 elections is likely not where the fight for House control will end. The White House is looking to Ohio, where a unique state law requires the legislature to approve new maps this year, as well as Missouri, Florida, Indiana, and South Carolina, where Republicans are in full control of state governments, as opportunities to add more favorable districts. Democratic governors in Illinois, Maryland, and New York have also floated redrawing their maps to add more Democratic-leaning districts.\n\nBeyond the partisan battle for control, the redrawn maps in Texas also directly harms the voting power of minorities in Texas, By cramming many minority neighborhoods into one seat, the Texas legislature dilutes their voting power. This practice directly undermines equal representation and is a clear violation of the Voting Rights Act. The result is that minority voters are left with less political influence, even in areas where they make up a significant share of the population.\n\nBut gerrymandering as a whole signals a wider problem with the system; it makes government power feel less about the will of the people and more about the manipulation of district lines. Today's battle for control is only the beginning and will certainly bring more chaos in the future.",

    "content": "America is in a second Gilded Age. Fortunately for us, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel: progressivism. Indeed, throughout the late 19th century, poor working conditions, widespread corruption, and extreme wealth inequality galvanized an entire generation to fight for reform. Similarly, today, thousands of well-informed citizens are laying the early groundwork for another progressive era. Yet, both parties, red and blue, are overwhelmingly in opposition to a change in the status quo. As of three days ago, Minnesota Democrats revoked their endorsement of Democratic Socialist Omar Fateh for the mayoral office in Minneapolis. The unprecedented decision comes at a crucial time. Just last month, Mr. Fateh beat out centrist democrat Jacob Frey, the incumbent mayor, for the nomination at the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party convention. Now, a small faction of the party has decided to overturn the will of many delegates who democratically offered their input. Fateh's campaign is focused on affordable housing, taxing the rich, and fighting back against invasive immigration policies. Establishment democrats appear to be scared by any campaign that prioritizes standing up against corporate interests because it's a direct threat to their power. The most evident example presents itself in New York, where Andrew Cuomo, a disgraced Democrat politician, appeals to corporate donors for support against the populist Zohran Mamdani. In fact, Cuomo is bankrolled by the same billionaires Trump is. What's worse is that the former governor is now going directly to President Trump, asking for help in the upcoming election. It's clear that \"donkey and elephant\" are on the same side. So who's on the other side? The people.\n\nThe local mayoral races across the nation are emblematic of a larger issue: the Democratic Party does not platform progressive values or voices. In the 2024 election, the strategy of Harris-Walz was puzzling to say the least. In the pursuit of reeling in swing voters and doubtful conservatives away from MAGA, leftists were alienated. Kamala Harris was unable to condemn Israel's blatant genocide or support anti-fracking measures, leading to a dissonance between what voters wanted and what Harris promised. Regardless of political affiliation, the people have grown weary of the status quo. Instead of capitalizing on a disillusioned America, Harris offered more of the same.\n\nThe problem is party leadership. More than half of democrats support a shift towards progressivism, a sentiment not echoed among the party's leaders. Indeed, the Democratic response to the violation of civil liberties, expansion of corporate interests, and downright descent into authoritarianism has been lackluster among senior members. That's precisely why new-age democrats across the nation are challenging out-of-touch incumbents across the nation. In the Bay Area, Saikat Chakrabarti challenges the corrupt Nancy Pelosi and her chokehold on San Francisco politics. Rashida Tlaib, representative of Michigan's 12th district, consistently calls out her peers and their complicit role in the genocide of Gaza. In Maine, Graham Platner says Democrats are doing \"jack\" about the rise of fascism. Omar Fateh, as mentioned earlier, is vying for a chance to progress the stagnant Minneapolis politics controlled by moderates. Maybe most recognizable of all, Zohran Mamdani has captured the entire nation's attention with outstanding charisma, eloquent policy-making, and a stylized campaign focused on elevating the working class in the world's biggest city. Fresh faces all around the nation's biggest battlegrounds show that progressivism is here, loud and proud.\n\nIn the upcoming 2026 election, the Democratic Party has to win big. In order to carve a path to success, the party must not repeat the same mistakes of the past. Now, amidst a second Gilded Age, it is of utmost importance for democrats to show their willingness to advocate for the people. That includes being openly critical of Israel, supporting taxation on the one percent, and prioritizing working-class interests over all else. The Republican Party has co-opted populism for far too long. As a new wave of progressive candidates fights for a place in today's politics, the Democratic Party must cement itself as the party of the people.",

    "content": "One afternoon in Gaza, the sky opens with parachutes of false hope. Families, not knowing if the sounds come from aid packages or bombs, peek out of their tents to glimpse at what they hope could be relief to their starvation: bundles of food falling from the sky. Seconds later, the hope turns to panic. The crates crash through the weak cloth that makes up the tents and onto the children below. Other groups were in a crowded alleyway, killing a prominent Gazan nurse who had just filmed a video denouncing the drops as \"humiliation disguised as aid.\" Days before, pleading for help to end the starvation, he said, \"If they can fly planes to drop aid, they can open the crossings and let trucks bring real help.\" His words ring harder after this death.\n\nIn 2025, after international humanitarian programs like UNRWA have not been allowed entry, this is the reality of Gaza. Instead of being delivered from the closed checkpoints, it falls without care from military planes, crushing shelters, starting stampedes, and creating fights between families over inadequate amounts of rice and flour. Far from stopping starvation, the aid has become a cruel way of trying to avoid international criticism: an instrument of distraction, hasbara, and oftentimes death for Palestinians.\n\nThese airdrops were announced (with partners in Jordan and the UAE) in late July 2025, and promised as \"safe corridors\" of humanitarian assistance. In reality, the program has been lethal. At least 124 people have been struck by the aid packages, with 23 Palestinians being outright killed. International human rights groups are also sounding an alarm, stating that the airdrops are \"a humiliating spectacle that exacerbates suffering,\" emphasizing that only allowing land corridors to be opened would address the urgent need to stop the starvation. UNRWA, calling for the crossings to be opened, condemned the drops as being nowhere near being able to meet the needs of the Gaza population. As The Washington Post reports, the airdrops often weigh over 1,000 pounds, can easily go astray, and should only be used when there are \"actual geographic barriers,\" such as flooding and earthquakes, that block roads.\n\nThis ineffective method of delivering aid comes when thousands of aid trucks, capable of alleviating the famine that haunts millions of Palestinians, sit idle at Israeli-controlled border checkpoints. More than 6,000 trucks filled with food and medicine are waiting outside Gaza, blocked by military checkpoints as the population starves. Under the pressure of falling aid crates with no targets, families are fighting with knives over the aid, with one woman recalling her elderly father nearly crushed by a bundle while others clawed at the box before rescuing him.\n\nThe tragedy and loss of life extend beyond the falling crates. On the ground, Israel and the U.S. have replaced international aid groups with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation(GHF): less of an organization to deliver aid, and more of a political tool where Palestinians are surveilled, having to walk for hours or days to reach the scarce and far-apart checkpoints, rarely receiving aid in inadequate provisions.\n\nAs civilians line up to receive access to food, the UN confirms that at least 1,373 Palestinians have been killed. 859 of these were near GHF sites, and over 500 were near other convoys. For Israel, the strategy to get away with these killings has been designating areas less than 500 feet away from aid checkpoints as \"combat zones,\" and then firing on civilians who inevitably gather there.\n\nWhile military airdrops and food lines lined with blood may convince some otherwise, the easy solution to this crisis is ending Israel's illegal blockade. As the UN Secretary-General and numerous other organizations describe the famine, it is a purely man-made disaster caused by the deliberate Israeli denial of essential items for survival. Over half a million Palestinians are in conditions of starvation, where only 4% of households can access clean water, and food prices have increased by 4,000%. \"I have a family of seven. The last time we had a real full meal was two weeks ago,\" says a Palestinian in Deir al Balah. Testimony from those inside Gaza paints the real picture. As a journalist from the Guardian described, \"I saw devastated hospitals, mass graves, and bodies eaten by dogs in the street.\"\n\nThese distractions of \"aid\" aren't just ineffective; they are done to serve political goals. Continuing a genocide while having \"humanitarian agencies\" to point to gives the Israeli government a propaganda tool to hide the siege on the Gazan people. To avoid international criticism of the Israeli killing of journalists or attacks on schools, mosques, and hospitals, Israel points to the GHF.\n\nTo avoid calls for any international group to deliver aid, Israel and the U.S. government accuse UNRWA and other neutral distributors of accusing Hamas of \"stealing their aid.\" But as the American government's own internal review found, there is no evidence of Hamas having a systematic program of stealing supplies. The purpose of the GHF model has always been control, not \"efficiency.\"\n\nIn contrast, \"theft of aid\" has been committed by Israeli-backed groups in Gaza. Popular Forces, an Israeli-backed group, looted 98 out of 109 trucks carrying food through the Kerem Shalom crossing, showing how aid has been weaponized by the Israeli government, whether on air or ground.\n\nEven aid workers are targeted. In April of 2024, vehicles carrying staff from the World Central Kitchen were struck by Israeli drones, killing staff members from the U.S., U.K., and Australia. Far from \"accidental,\" the attack was cleared by Israeli military staff, making the strike an egregious violation of international law.\n\nThe attacks on Gaza have decimated the health infrastructure. Hospitals are run without electricity, surgeries are performed without any anesthesia on children, and diseases are spreading in densely packed camps. As illnesses caused by famine are overwhelming the already-lacking facilities in Gaza, doctors are being forced to choose which children to treat. As a Gazan doctor told the BBC, \"Because of the shortage of painkillers, we leave patients to scream for hours and hours.\"\n\nIt's become undeniable that the reality for Palestinians has been genocide. Even groups within Israel, such as B'Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights–Israel, have described the starvation campaign as a form of such. As the Atlantic Council has reported, the limited distribution campaign in Gaza has been designed not to save Gaza, but to control it and deepen displacement.\n\nAs more than 80,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, with thousands more expected to die from hunger and disease in the coming months, we are seeing the outcome of the deliberate policy of extinction coming from the Israeli government. If the international community allows the genocide to continue, then we too will be complicit. Starvation, disease, and displacement are not accidental byproducts of war but purposeful outcomes of the system designed to erase a people while maintaining a facade of \"humanitarian concern.\" What Gaza needs is not false hope through charity from the sky, but true justice on the ground: an end to the blockade, a ceasefire that stops the murdering of civilians, and respect for Palestinians' right to live in freedom. Until then, every crate that falls is not relief, it is a reminder of a world that has lost its humanity.",

    "content": "In the Trump Administration's latest pursuit of rolling back diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, the unfortunate victim is research funding. Back in June, William Young, a judge for the U.S. District Court, ruled that the cutting of nearly 800 grants was based on discrimination, not a legal one. Therefore, he ruled that the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) must continue making payments towards the research grants. Our current administration, dismayed with the District Court's decision, immediately went to work on getting their order up and running. Solicitor General D. John Sauer pleaded to the Supreme Court Justices to evaluate the lower courts' ruling. The pleading worked as a 5-4 decision from the Supreme Court granted a path forward for Trump and his allies. Crucially, the money cut was not going to D.E.I. programs; instead, the money was going towards research on areas like racial health disparities and transgender health.\n\nWhy is \"D.E.I.\" a target?\n\nD.E.I. has been a long-standing point of attack for Trump's second administration. Indeed, his dangerous rhetoric on the topic has sewn seeds of division for years now. That's because D.E.I. is an easy target. Following the racial movements of 2020, D.E.I. was instituted in many corporations, organizations, and schools as a reaction to the exposure of systemic oppression. Yet, the implementation of these programs has always drawn criticism. So, the Trump administration capitalized on a negative public perception and expanded it much further. If Trump can convince working-class Americans that their financial status, opportunities, and jobs are directly stolen by the \"other\", then progress is unlikely to occur. A clear goal of an administration backed by the oligarchy is to root out any sentiment of working-class solidarity. Dividing the working class based on racial lines feeds into the future that Trump wants for America. Moreover, it's easy to spread misinformation about D.E.I. In today's example, scientific research on the intersection between health, gender, and race is labeled as \"D.E.I.\" instead of what it truly is, life-saving work.\n\nAlthough the Trump administration's actions can be seen as misinformed and chaotic, everything is purposeful. $783 million is a lot of money going to a cause that officials at the White House couldn't care less about. Instead, that same 783 million dollars could be spent on policy that better aligns with the Trump Administration's goals, such as building detention centers, strengthening ICE, and funding Israel. Indeed, D.E.I. is just an example of a wider trend in which the Trump Administration slashes federal funds towards anything they don't like, excusing their recklessness by crying \"woke\" over and over again. Crucially, the programs that are continually targeted are meant for the people. Research on health inequalities has the potential to ameliorate the conditions of many marginalized groups across the world. Reversal of grants for scientific innovation only stifles progress, nothing else. Once again, the Trump administration's blatant, discriminatory actions come at the cost of Americans. As the Supreme Court paves the way for 783 million dollars in research funding for public health to be cut, remember that \"D.E.I.\" is just an excuse, not the problem.",

    "content": "President Trump's recent approach to foreign policy on our southern border is an echo of 21st-century American failures. This August, the president signed a directive authorizing the Pentagon to prepare strikes against Mexican drug cartels, groups the administration has now designated as terrorist organizations. In response, over 30 humanitarian groups have sounded alarms, warning that the move could launch a new front in the \"forever wars\" of the Middle East, destabilizing our continent.\n\nThe logic of Trump's orders is familiar. Under the guise of \"national security,\" the armed forces are being prepared to be unleashed on problems that history has shown can't be solved through bombs. Far from just bad foreign policy, this step towards militarism is only another step towards authoritarian power, both at home and abroad.\n\nWhile this should be simple, our government has already spent more than a trillion dollars trying to eradicate the drug issue through force and prohibition. Meanwhile, deaths from drug-related causes only continue to climb, well surpassing 100,000. For decades, aggressive drug policy across Latin America has been unsuccessful and has only increased violence: from Plan Colombia, which armed anti-leftist leaders without actually decreasing drug usage, to the Mérida Initiative, which resulted in Mexican torture camps rather than real solutions. Despite billions going towards violent means of combating the drug crisis, the result has been more than 350,000 dead, and tens of thousands more have disappeared.\n\nFar from weakening cartels, Trump's campaign will only encourage them to splinter into more violent and destructive factions. In past years, militaristic crackdowns haven't decreased violence; instead, they create new incentives for traffickers to diversify their routes toward more dangerous areas, adopt more deadly tactics of smuggling, and resort to more violence. The idea that Trump's proposed raids will be the factor that finally dismantles cartels isn't just naïve; it risks making the issue worse.\n\nBy branding cartels \"terrorist organizations,\" Trump is reviving the post-9/11 toolkit of drone strikes, surveillance, and extrajudicial assassinations. That framework led to sprawling wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and beyond, costing trillions while destabilizing entire regions. As a result of these past failures, the Costs of War Project at Brown University estimates that our interventions have left between 4.5-4.7 million people dead and created tens of millions of refugees.\n\nReplicating this model of failure in Mexico would not help the drug crisis but leave Mexico's communities to bear the brunt of the bloodshed that U.S. military interventions have caused. As Stephanie Brewer of WOLA notes, \"overseas military strikes certainly won't solve drug overdose deaths in the U.S.,\" issues that would be better addressed through healthcare and harm-reduction programs.\n\nMexican President Sheinbaum has rejected Trump's prospect of troops crossing her border. After hearing Trump's rhetoric, she declared that \"there will be no invasion … it's absolutely off the table,\" showing that Trump's move can only be done through War on Terror-era violations of sovereignty. The push for unilateral action from the White House jeopardizes decades of our economic and political ties to Mexico that have been, for the most part, focused on trade and intelligence sharing rather than armed incursions.\n\nIf Trump ignores the threats from Sheinbaum and pushes ahead anyway, it risks causing anti-American sentiment to rise throughout Latin America, causing more violence, as we saw with our interventions in the Middle East. U.S. attacks on Mexico (Veracruz) in 1914 to anti-democratic interventions throughout Central America throughout the 20th century remain as wounds that Trump's threats risk reopening.\n\nThough it may seem so, considering Trump's tendency to make baseless statements, Trump's threats aren't unfounded in action. Yesterday, Trump ordered Navy warships into Latin American waters as part of this new campaign targeting cartel operations. Sources in the Pentagon confirm that the admin is looking into naval and drone strikes across our border, showing that despite Sheinbaum's pushback, plans are going ahead. Each new report draws us further away from Trump's campaign promise of \"No new wars.\"\n\nThe calls for military presence in Mexico are inseparable from Trump's approach to domestic policy. Already in Washington D.C. (with plans to expand across the Nation), the administration has expanded the military presence of U.S. troops on our soil, and along the border where migrants are detained without Constitutional rights under military authority. This blurring of the lines between \"war powers\" and law enforcement is being used by Trump as an excuse for authoritarian denial of civil liberties.\n\nAs the Financial Times explains, the rise of Latin America's cartels isn't a justification for greater military escalation, but, on the contrary, evidence of the failure of policies that don't address the root systemic causes of drug-related crimes. By doubling down on the Marines and military strikes, Trump is creating conditions for further cartel violence abroad while furthering justification for authoritarian policy at home.\n\nThe drug crisis isn't one with no solution. Portugal's decriminalization model has reduced overdoses and freed police resources to target more serious crime, by ensuring that drugs are monitored for safety, cartels have less power for violence by monopolizing control of drugs, and greater resources are allocated to mental health and addiction-based centers (rather than the current approach of fear of prosecution among addicts). Drug crises are best fought not with guns, but with mental health care, investment in communities, and prioritization of education.\n\nInvesting in Mexican communities: schools, jobs, and anti-corruption measures, offers far more potential for reducing drug trafficking than any military solution. As a recent study from Cornell suggests, long-term social spending, rather than violent crackdowns, reduces the dominance of cartels in Mexico.\n\nUnder the Constitution, Congress, not the president, has the authority to wage war. Civil advocacy groups are urging lawmakers to block Trump's recent acts before war becomes imminent, as any unilateral incursion into Mexico would not only be dangerous but also unlawful. For decades, both domestically and abroad, we have seen the United States repeat the cycle of militarized failure. Trump's more recent push only threatens to entrench it for another generation: fueling violence, deepening attacks on our Constitution, and leaving the actual crisis unsolved. If the public or Congress doesn't stop him now, we may find ourselves in another forever war, but this time in our hemisphere.",

    "content": "Absentee ballots are specifically ballots filled out when a voter is either out of town or is unable to vote in person at a ballot box. Absentee ballots usually require a specific reason to be able to fill them out, those reasons include being deployed in the military or being out of town. There are also no-excuse absentee ballots which are provided on a state by state basis. On to mail-in ballots, these are more of an umbrella term for all ballots submitted by mail and are more a state-by-state basis on validity. In short, absentee ballots are seen as a type of mail-in ballot.\n\nOn Monday, a push to end mail-in ballots became one of the president's top priorities after he announced it on his favorite social media site, Truth Social. Specifically, the president called the process a \"scam\" that was used to facilitate fraud. Claims of fraud when it comes to mail-in ballots are nothing new, in fact Trump has made these claims before in the aftermath of the 2020 election. Now while the president might be convinced that they cause fraud, the evidence goes against him. As a study shows, in Colorado and Washington, when they switched to mail-in ballots, fraud was actually lower than some states that stayed fully in person. Now, in order to fully end mail-in ballots, the President has said he will sign an executive order \"vowing\" to end it soon.\n\nThe hypocrisy of the President's statements about mail-in ballots is not lost either. If we rewind 4 years to the 2020 election, Donald Trump specifically called for his voters to use mail-in ballots to secure him the win. Additionally, he himself cast a mail-in ballot in multiple elections in 2020 which, for someone who claims that they are killing freedom, is not a good look. Not only this, but in even more recent claims this week, the President claimed that America was the only democratic country to use mail-in ballots. This is once again simply untrue, as at least 34 democratic countries worldwide, including France, Spain, Germany, and the United Kingdom, all allow mail in ballots for some or all voters depending on the country.\n\nTrump's suggestions that mail-in ballots are destroying freedom denies decades of international precedence and reverses American election policy.\n\nWhile a lot of what the President rants about on Truth Social may be incomprehensible, the effects of this attack on freedom is clearer than glass. One of the main problems here is that under the definition that most states use for mail-in ballots, absentee ballots also fall under the umbrella, meaning that our overseas military personnel will have to jump through hoops to be able to vote. Additionally this is an egregious rollback of American freedom, Trump's attacks on mail-in votes primarily serves as the most recent in a long series of power grabs to attempt to sway the 2026 elections. This is because the Democratic voter base is the base that uses mail-in ballots the most. The 2020 election primarily shows the difference in usage of mail-in ballots, where 58% of Democrats voted by mail that year compared to a much smaller 29% of Republicans. As a majority in the house continues to slip through the President's fingers, he has turned to impeding fair elections and overreaching his executive power to try and stop the shift. As even though the president has stated that he will sign an executive order to stop the act, the Constitution of America forbids this from actually happening. As the Constitution outlines that election processes are decided on a state-by-state basis, any attempt by the president to try and overrule this can be seen as a gross erosion of the state's powers.\n\nIn conclusion, the President's threat to end mail-in ballots is not the first and surely won't be the last attempt to steal our freedom.",

    "content": "AI data centers are primed to increase our energy consumption by untold amounts in the next twenty years. On top of this impending artificial energy demand, aggregate consumer energy demand is also expected to increase rapidly. Both of these problems require expedited solutions - and yet we are sleepwalking towards energy disaster.\n\nThe current state of our energy grid could be described as at best in disarray and at worst in genuine shambles. Not only is energy consumption scattered and inconsistent across the various power sources of coal/oil, natural gas, traditional renewables and nuclear, but the grid itself is divided into about five different sections only loosely connected. This means that instead of upgrading the grid all at once and connecting it, each part needs to be modernized and then connected, which is much, much harder. On top of this, our energy grid is one of the largest contributors to climate change, and the fossil fuel load is actively pushing us towards climate disaster.\n\nThe current solution being pushed is the \"renewable transition.\" This is the idea that, with enough investment, power sources like wind and solar will power most, if not all of our grid by the year 2035…or 2050…or 2070…or someday!\n\nSpoiler: it's not going to work - and even if our grid is \"powered by renewables\", fossil fuels will maintain a foothold right up until the grid is 100% renewables. Until renewables can deal with intermittency, the duck curve, and other limitations, fossil fuels will be right there to step in the gap. It's why they've spent so much money pushing renewables as the future of energy, and it's why they will continue to do so. The implications here are obvious: the continuation of the climate crisis, lack of energy, and overall collapse become more and more imminent.\n\nNuclear energy is the only power source that can combat fossil fuels in a way that actually replaces them (solving climate change) while still powering the entire grid (solving energy demand). We know this to be true both empirically and logically - after all, fossil fuels and nuclear energy are the only two sources of energy that provide base-load, steady and consistent power. As a result, renewables need one of the two to supplement them, and if we invest in nuclear energy, we choose the right option for a sustainable future - a 100% clean power source that is practically limitless.\n\nHowever, this investment is currently both insufficient and misprioritized. Not only are nuclear plant closures happening across the US, but most of the new nuclear infrastructure being built isn't replacing them. Why? Nuclear power is now almost solely kept alive by Big Tech, which seeks to harness nuclear energy to power AI data centers, while consumers are hung out to dry.\n\nUltimately, this problem calls for a couple of crucial steps by the US government. First, an immediate injection of investment to stop existing plant closures across the US. Second, a secondary investment in the new technologies of the day - whether it be IFR's from Oklo or SMR's from NuScale - to meet consumer energy demand. And third and finally, improved rhetoric and tone towards nuclear energy to make the public more accepting of it, especially when the fossil fuel industry spent millions making sure that the public feared nuclear through extensive propaganda campaigns.\n\nThe solution is staring us in the face. It's time to follow through.",

    "content": "In an already arid climate, emerging data centers endanger the stability of a water resource used by millions of people. The Colorado River, a victim of Big Tech's relentless pursuit of profits, provides water to approximately 40 million people across seven states. Honing in on the Grand Canyon State, Arizona, local government officials wisely decided against the implementation of \"Project Blue\" —an Amazon-backed initiative. Lobbyists and proponents of the project continually cited economic development and employment opportunities as a way to deflect attention away from the climate consequences. Simply put, large data centers, akin to \"Project Blue\", utilize millions of gallons of water nearly every day. With the rise of artificial intelligence technologies, the trend of using up a depleting water source doesn't show any signs of slowing down soon. Importantly, water going to these massive centers is water not going to Americans who need it most.\n\nData centers are commonplace in Arizona. Companies are looking for vast amounts of land, so it stands to reason that a seemingly endless desert would be the ideal place for a stadium-sized warehouse filled with immense computing power. Unfortunately, these computers need to keep cool. That's precisely where the water comes into play. In the desert, a technique known as adiabatic cooling employs water-moistened pads to cool the surrounding air. The most crucial step in the process is the copious amounts of H20 used. In Goodyear, Arizona, just one data center's annual gallon consumption equates to 670 Goodyear households.\n\nIn addition to the land, Arizona offers a profitable tax environment for businesses for two main reasons. First, the state offers tax exemptions on equipment and power under the Transaction Privilege Tax. Second, there is no inventory tax either, leading to cheaper warehouses and centers.\n\nThe data centers popping up across the country are already in areas with high levels of water stress. Over time, the rapid growth of these centers cannot be sustained. Indeed, the red line is sooner than you may think. Although it is impossible to fully know the extent to which data centers threaten the Southwest, we have already seen some signs of water depletion. The Central Arizona Project states, \"The Colorado River Basin continues to experience drought and the impacts of hotter and drier conditions.\" A.I will not help the ongoing shortage. According to a report from Western Resource Advocates, \"data centers in Arizona could grow from 4.5 billion gallons in 2030 to 7 billion gallons annually by 2035, which is enough water to support nearly 200,000 people per year.\"\n\nThe obvious answer to the issue is to follow in Tucson's footsteps: say no. However, most cities in Arizona cannot afford to do that. Big Tech offers them an undeniable boost to local revenue that saying no to is damn near impossible. City Council members in Goodyear face various challenges as Microsoft bargains for more and more each year. For a small city like Goodyear, they cannot turn down lucrative deals that bring their constituents much-needed jobs. So, where does the solution come from? The answer is in renewable technologies. It's clear that data centers will always be necessary and will always persist, yet improving the process to ensure that water stays available to the 40 million people who depend on it is crucial. There are a couple of ways to go about reforming the operations. For example, utilizing rainwater instead of groundwater will keep the Colorado River safer as time goes on.\n\nBig Tech continues to profit from the exploitation of resources, this time at the detriment of American citizens in the Southwest. However, it isn't all hopeless. Tucson fought back at the local level and was able to successfully fend off intrusion from an Amazon-led initiative with millions of dollars in resources behind it. Moreover, the implementation of new, innovative methods of cooling could improve the damaging process. Through it all, one thing is clear: the unsustainable practices used today simply cannot continue.",

    "content": "Last week, President Trump hosted Putin in Anchorage, and the world watched for a sign of peace in a war that lasted over 3 years. Instead, the summit only lasted three hours, and ended in Ukraine being on the sidelines, and Putin returning to Moscow \"with an air of triumph.\" The meeting crystallized a familiar story of the U.S. bending towards autocrats.\n\nFor Trump, the goal doesn't seem to be peace at all. Instead, it seems to be just stringing up a ceasefire deal as quickly as possible, so he can get a peace prize. NBC News reports that \"Trump and his aides are intensifying a public campaign to snag the award, citing a string of peace deals while making a case that snubbing him again would be an injustice.\" The goal of our foreign policy isn't protecting lives, it's getting our president an award. In fact, when India pointed out that the ceasefire between them and Pakistan wasn't orchestrated by Trump, we reversed 20 years of progress working with India, imposing drastic tariffs. As a result, Modi is now visiting India for the first time in years. For Putin, a path forward seems simple. Create a ceasefire on biased terms so Trump is happy, then start the war again after Trump gets the prize to claim more territory.\n\nThe absence of Ukraine at the meeting was not coincidental; it was by design. President Zelensky was told by Trump after the summit that Putin only wanted more of Ukraine and that Kyiv would have to accept a tough future. Negotiating the fate of a sovereign nation without its presence at the table evokes scenes of 20th-century appeasement.\n\nSo what occurred at the summit? Well, very little. No ceasefire emerged, and Trump seemed to pivot from an immediate end to the war to a \"broader peace framework instead,\" not explaining what this would entail. For his goals of the peace prize, the framework is likely capitulation of territory. At the meeting, Putin refused to budge on territorial gains in Donetsk and Luhansk, territories Zelenskyy has maintained should always be considered Ukrainian land.\n\nThe topics, however, seemed to favor Moscow. In Russia, Putin was celebrated for holding his ground. In contrast, Trump's performance was criticized as deferential and showed an image of an American president bowing to an authority and failing to defend democracy. As Senator Chris Murphy put it, the summit looked more like \"a photo-op for Putin than a step towards peace,\" and that the summit \"legitimizes war crimes.\" Towards our allies, the summit sends the signal that we are not committed to peace.\n\nThe promise of \"security guarantees\" for Ukraine doesn't seem to be of substance. While parties in the admin, such as envoy Steve Witkoff, claimed that the summit was \"game-changing,\" and Senator Rubio claimed that \"both Russia and Ukraine must make concessions.\" Yet, these statements were not based on facts. They provided the illusion of progress, while at the summit, not a inch of Ukrainian land was protected.\n\nFor Ukrainians themselves, the meeting was devastating. Despite claims that Ukraine would be protected, refugees interviewed by The Times of London expressed despair about the fact that decisions about their homeland were being made without them, with them describing the summit as a betrayal and just another broken promise. The voices of the people that matter most aren't being protected.\n\nWhile the U.S. and Russia left Anchorage without any agreement, Ukraine sees in the chaos that unfolded an opening to rally international support due to American failures. For Europe, the need to double down on alliances and defense is only increasing. In the end, the Alaska summit won't be remembered for what it achieved, but what it revealed about our government. It shows that American diplomatic goals, in the lands of leaders concerned more about their optics than protecting global justice, can drift towards appeasement.",

    "content": "On the land lying south of Lake Okeechobee, there is a fight brewing that environmentalists say could unravel decades of work in restoration. The Southland Water Resource Project, often criticized as the \"Big Sugar\" rock mine, is a proposed project to excavate nearly 8,600 acres of limestone in the Everglades Agricultural Area and has been pitched as a solution for water storage. But for opponents, the project is much more troubling: the result of a politically connected industry seeking industrial extraction with the justification of public good.\n\nThis latest controversy shows the root imbalance between corporations and ecological protection. In this case, \"Big Sugar,\" a moniker representing the interests of U.S. Sugar and Florida Crystals, does not just represent a sector of business, but a political machine that can shape government agencies and policy for the interest of profits. The mine's approval process reflects the systemic flaws in our government: that state regulators can advance permits without an independent hydrological review standard for such a project, local officials siding with industry promises against the caution of scientists, and only the public left to advocate against the risk to the environment.\n\nThe distrust that the public feels is only exacerbated by the timeline of the proposal. In just May of this year, Palm Beach County commissioners rezoned the land around the project to allow for mining, and by summertime, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection had already issued an Environmental Resource Permit for Phase 1 of the project, much faster than the months to years it usually takes for a project that has so much potential to affect a key area of biodiversity. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in a letter this July, warned that the project could have detrimental effects on the Everglades reservoir project that has cost $4 billion: compromising its structure and undermining what is considered Florida's largest clean-water project. Environmental scientists have pointed out the fragile porous geology beneath the site and raised concerns about the lack of seepage modeling.\n\nThese warnings from federal and scientific voices should have triggered a halt, not a green light to the project. Florida's governance, despite being branded as caring for Environmental goals, has prioritized \"economic development\" over ecological safety and given in to the \"Big Sugar\" donors. \"You don't build a $4 billion clean-water solution only to blow it up from the inside,\" said Capt. Daniel Andrews of Captains for Clean Water, urging Florida residents to pressure their legislators against the mine.\n\nIn response to these environmental effects, the Everglades Law Center, representing the Tropical Audubon Society, filed a legal challenge to the permit given this August, a move that could stall a dangerous precedent: industrial excavation and development in nearby proximity to critical ecological infrastructure. The lawsuit isn't simply about the one mine, but about stopping a pattern in which environmental protections are eroded through ineffective regulation.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, the Everglades Agricultural Area was carved out from wetlands through massive draining projects, an example of prioritizing agriculture over the health of our ecosystem. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) and other stormwater treatment areas have been trying to reverse that damage. Allowing a Big Sugar-aligned mine to operate in the Area is more than just a misstep; it's a retreat from our past commitments to protecting biodiversity.\n\nIf the project ends up proceeding, it will signal that even restoration projects once considered crucial to the state can be compromised when they collide with the interests of lobbies in our government. The question isn't whether the mine will affect restoration, but how much damage we can tolerate before our government realizes it is becoming too much.",

    "content": "One day out from Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin's summit meeting, the stakes in Ukraine have never been higher. The U.S believes Putin is fully committed to ending the conflict, yet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has his concerns. Ukraine has not been offered a seat at the table in Alaska. On top of that, Trump's rhetoric around the topic sets off all kinds of alarms as the strategy looks to be appeasement. Last Friday, Trump commented that there would be \"some swapping of territories to the betterment of both.\" Given the current administration's track record with Zelensky, a deal could potentially come at the cost of the Ukrainian people.\n\nTrump is adamant on a couple of key aspects surrounding upcoming negotiations. First, if the meeting goes well, a second summit will be organized, this time including Ukraine. Moreover, President Trump has stated that there will be \"severe consequences\" if Putin does not agree to the end of the war. The repercussions will likely take the form of economic sanctions. Even with Trump's outward disapproval of Putin's war, we still need to remain vigilant. European officials have raised concerns questioning whether the Trump we get in Anchorage, Alaska, will be as tough on Putin as he claims to be. Indeed, Zelensky and his allies are worried about negotiations ending with Kiev getting the short end of the stick. Comparing Trump's extended history with Putin to his fiery outburst against Zelensky, it is clear why unease has risen. In February, Zelensky's meeting with the current president proved fruitless as the diplomatic talks turned into more of a screaming match, with Vice President J.D. Vance involved as well. On the other side, Trump has continually praised Putin as a friend. In fact, on his first day in office, Trump tried to reignite the sparks of friendship by conveying remorse for Putin's isolated position in global politics.\n\nRussian leader Vladimir Putin is a notorious smooth-talker with decades of experience in buying time. This time, in Alaska, the trap is set for Trump to walk into. Putin plans to capitalize on the previous anti-Ukraine stance Trump has taken, when he falsely puts the blame on Ukraine for starting the war in the first place. Crucially, Trump is not wrong when he claims that Russia is looking for a peace deal. The piece of the puzzle missing, however, is the cost at which peace will arrive: land. As aforementioned, the White House has already reaffirmed its willingness for this deal to \"swap territories\". Putin, in his calculations, has realized that it is all about perspective. Moscow has already gained legitimacy and recognition for their pursuit of Ukraine by the mere existence of this meeting and the exclusion of Zelensky. A summit alone with the U.S will be sure to stir up some pro-Russian sentiment in the White House's mind. Thus, further negotiations will see the U.S. more inclined to cede land to the Russians, at the expense of Ukrainian citizens.\n\nAt his best, Trump has been wishy-washy regarding guarantees of security to Ukraine. Right now, Kiev needs confirmation, not uncertainty. President Trump is running a campaign. Not another presidency, but instead for a Nobel Peace Prize. That's precisely why he was seen shaking the hands of leaders from Azerbaijan and Armenia. However, in the delicate situation of Ukraine, Trump's political games could come at the cost of real peace. Moreover, history does not seem to promise a promising outcome for Zelensky and the rest of Europe as well. The diplomatic strategy that the Trump administration seems to take when it comes to Russia is a danger to the Ukrainian people and all of Europe, who want to resist Russian hegemony. Ahead of tomorrow, one thing is clear: Trump must not fall for Putin's ploy for peace.",

    "content": "Traditionally, the process of drawing election maps has followed a standard principle. Every 10 years, a census is taken to determine the makeup of our population. States then use the census results to create districts where elections for the House of Representatives take place. However, in an unprecedented move, Texas Republicans are deviating from this trend. Likely as a result of the Republican Party's unfavorability heading into the 2026 elections, they have decided to gerrymander to try not to be humiliated in 2026.\n\nGerrymandering to make it easier to win elections is deeply unpopular. YouGov polling shows that 69% of Americans oppose partisan redrawing to win elections, and 74% oppose racial redrawing. In Texas, both of these unpopular objectives are being accomplished. The proposed maps divide Central Texas's 35th district, one that was made by courts to protect minority voting rights. Even though changing the maps like Texas is doing is blatantly unconstitutional, the Supreme Court seems afraid to make any rulings that would be looked down upon by Trump and the GOP. A big reason for the map changes seems to come from Trump himself, with him saying that Texas is \"entitled to 5 more Republican seats.\"\n\nAs a result of the planned redrawing, Democrats in the Texas legislature left the state for places such as Illinois, so that the session would not meet the required number of members to begin. Many still have stayed outside of Texas, but some are budging and moving back as a result of threats of arrest and expulsion from Governor Greg Abbott and other Republican leaders using the FBI as blackmail. On Wednesday, the DNC's place of stay in Illinois was threatened to be bombed.\n\nDemocrats recently walked out of the legislature, blocking Republicans from reaching the quorum needed to move the bill forward. As of Friday, the map had not progressed in the legislature, despite threats of arrest, expulsion, and FBI involvement from Gov. Greg Abbott and other GOP leaders. This past Wednesday, Texas Democrats' temporary hideout in Illinois was targeted with a bomb threat. Despite all of this chaos, there is precedent to this walkout. Democrats left in 2003 to block similar redistricting, and in 2021 to protest voter-suppression laws. Republicans haven't seemed to budge. Abbott has already announced he will end the current special session and begin a new one with the same redistricting agenda, betting that persistence will outlast the boycott.\n\nThe proposed maps that reconfigure key blue districts in cities such as Houston, Dallas, and Austin, according to Republican leaders, are designed to reflect \"political changes.\" But it's clear, as Republicans are only getting less popular due to immigration, handling of the Epstein files, and economic policy, the intent is about dismantling multi-racial Democratic districts into majority-white Republican areas.\n\nThe proposed maps would reconfigure key districts in Houston, Dallas–Fort Worth, Austin, and South Texas. According to Republican leaders, the changes are designed to \"reflect political performance.\" Critics say the intent is less about accuracy and more about entrenchment: dismantling multiracial coalition districts and dispersing Black and Latino voters into majority-white, GOP-leaning areas. As Justin Levitt, professor of law for Loyola Marymount University, stated, \"I don't think [Trump's] planning on those five seats alone. At this point, the president is staring at historic unpopularity and having to sell a historically unpopular signature piece of legislation, while the very normal midterm waves tend to go against the party of president. He is petrified at losing control of Congress, and it's much more than the normal petrified because of him. He knows it's going to come with oversight, with investigations, and stop his passage of what's been a historically unpopular public program.\"\n\n**The Numbers Game, and Possible Implications**\n\nCurrently, Texas sends 25 Republicans and 13 Democrats to the House. The new Republican map would raise that to 30 Republican seats if the maps and elections go in their favor, which could be decisive in such a tight chamber. The walkouts of the Democrats, while unlikely to stop the plans of the Texas GOP, could trigger court intervention or public backlash against the Republicans.\n\nFurthermore, Texas's aggression has already prompted responses about redrawing maps in other states. In California, Governor Gavin Newsom has hinted at a redraw to regain Democratic seats in 2022, a big shift in a state that has historically been proud of its independent redistricting commission. Although abandoning the commission's work could invite accusations of hypocrisy, Newsom sees the action as necessary to be done to combat the threat from Republicans in 2026.\n\nOther states, such as Illinois and New York, are also exploring possibilities of changing their maps, after significant pressure from Governor Newsom. The phenomenon isn't simply a blue-state issue. Republicans in Missouri and Indiana are trying to make their changes. The tit-for-tat battle between states seems certain to invite political chaos in the future.\n\nThe effects of these changes in the midterms will likely be very drastic, depending on which states successfully change their maps. If Texas secures five new GOP seats and states like California don't respond, the GOP could enter the cycle with a massive advantage. Legal challenges could delay map changes for both parties in key states, making it hard to predict what challenges will be able to be addressed. In the end, no matter how voters and the courts decide, Texas may have already set a template for a new phase of American politics, not fighting over the minds of the public, but the maps that choose them.",

    "content": "President Donald Trump is quick to call in the US National Guard for any situation he deems necessary. Beginning with the city of Los Angeles and its countless ICE raids endured, it has spread to the nation's capital, where nearly 800 troops have flooded the so-called \"lawless\" district. In addition to the 23 arrests made overnight, the US Park Police has removed 70 homeless encampments around the streets of the city. Trump recollects an anecdote his father told him, \" Son, when you walk into a restaurant and you see a dirty front door, don't go in. Because if the front door is dirty, the kitchen is dirty also.\" The president applies the same logic here by comparing our capital to the front door. Yet, nowhere does Trump substantiate his claim about Washington, D.C. The incessant rhetoric paints a vivid picture, yet reality shows an entirely different perspective. D.C is not in a public safety emergency because of its citizens. It is a public safety emergency due to the Trump administration's continued overreach, lack of care for its citizens, and malicious intent for the near future.\n\nAt the time of writing this article, three minutes ago, The Washington Post gained access to exclusive documents detailing a new plan for a nationwide militia dealing with situations of civil unrest. Specifically, \"The plan calls for 600 troops to be on standby at all times so they can deploy in as little as one hour\". Documents call for military bases of 300 troops each in Alabama and Arizona for quick deployment across the entire nation. Entitled \"Domestic Civil Disturbance Quick Reaction Force,\" this development violates the civil liberties of every single U.S. citizen, effectively rendering our country a police state. The implications for a militia used on American soil to oppress American citizens are massive. The National Guard in D.C. was the first step.\n\nData shows violent crime rates in D.C. have been declining, contradicting Trump's claims of lawlessness\n\nWashington, D.C. has a decreasing crime rate. Crime has been on a downward trend over the past two years and is likely to continue doing so. Yet, the words echoed by the administration would lead you to a different conclusion. The most common excuse is calling the city entirely \"lawless\". However, Trump and his allies are merely looking for a reason to expand their unconstitutional breach of authority. First, starting with the nation's capital, where the executive has the most power, then expanding into all 50 of America's states. The grasp of power is evident not only because of the leaked documents, but also because it aligns with the central goal of the Trump administration: to perpetuate fear.\n\nPolitical dissidents, journalists, politicians of opposing views, and nearly every citizen are in danger if the United States, a country founded on the principle of free speech, transforms into a police state. Meanwhile, those in power stand to benefit from absolute control over the people. The formation of a militant group targeting American citizens isn't a step towards fascism; it's a leap. Moreover, the emphasis on \"cleaning out\" the homeless in D.C. showcases massive dangers for America's marginalized populations. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt of the White House repeats, \"Homeless shelters, [being] offered addiction and mental health services, or jail if they refuse, are the options on the table right now.\" Aside from the ridiculousness of the demand, the fact of the matter is that these undisclosed homeless shelters and institutions away from the city are suspicious at best. No details on the location, quality, mode of transportation, or even existence have been provided. Crucially, the other option is jail. Although it cannot be said with certainty, I doubt there will ever be a choice to begin with.\n\nThe Trump administration continually utilizes dangerous rhetoric to further peddle its ambitious policy goals. Citing crime, homelessness, dirtiness, and lawlessness, Trump is crafting a deceptive narrative to get what he wants. The MAGA agenda starts at the heart of our nation: our capital. The deployment of the US National Guard is the first building block towards a police state. The next big piece is the materialization of a nationwide militia imposed on U.S. citizens at the whims of the White House. \"When the people part with power, they can seldom or never resume it again but by force.\" If we let our government consolidate absolute power with the establishment of the Domestic Civil Disturbance Quick Reaction Force, then the chances of returning to normalcy are slim. Our government's grasp for repressive control cannot, should not, and will not be realized.",

    "content": "History teaches us that silencing the press is the first step to silencing the truth. From NATO's shelling of media buildings during the Kosovo war to targeted killings of journalists by U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, regimes during both times of peace and war have seen the importance of controlling the narrative. In Syria, Bashar al-Assad's forces routinely bombed areas known to hold media to hide war crimes. Right now in Ukraine, Russia has detained independent journalists who have disappeared after uncovering evidence of massacres against civilians. These aren't \"unfortunate occurrences during war,\" they are calculated moves to avoid condemnation. Remove the witnesses of your atrocities, and the crime is easier to commit. Kill the storytellers, and stories can't be written.\n\nSince 1948, Israel's record has been characterized by massacres against the press. For decades, both journalists from Palestine and broad coverage of the occupation have faced harassment, expulsions, and in many cases, death. The 2022 killing of renowned Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh while she covered a raid in Jenin, in the West Bank, remains one of the most infamous examples. Independent investigations, using a review of audio, photo, and witness evidence, including by The Washington Post, concluded that she was certainly killed by an Israeli soldier. Yet, despite the acknowledgement by the U.S. that Israeli fire was \"likely responsible,\" Israel faced zero consequence, her death was ruled \"unintentional,\" and no one faced any accountability. Killing a reporter, even in broad daylight with a marked press vest, carried no real consequences to the IDF.\n\nThat pattern has not only persisted; With Israel seeing that they haven't faced any consequence, they have escalated their attacks. Yesterday, a targeted Israeli drone strike on tents near Al-Shifa Hospital killed an entire Al-Jazeera crew, including Pulitzer Prize-winning Anas al-Sharif, along with independent journalist Mohamad al-Khaldi. Eyewitnesses and medics confirmed no fighting was occurring at the time, and Israel admitted responsibility soon after the attacks. Israel used their usual excuse, claiming al-Sharif was a \"Hamas commander\" who was involved in rocket attacks, but offered no evidence. Al-Sharif has consistently been reporting on the ground for Al-Jazeera, wearing a press jacket, far from being a militant. To international organizations such as the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders, this represents déjà vu: the same lies, lack of proof, and murder of journalists trying to document genocide.\n\nBeyond the tragic incident that occurred yesterday is the broader scale of violence against civilians, documenting the conflict. Since October 7th, 2023, at least 269 journalists have been killed by Israel forces, the deadliest conflict for media workers ever recorded. The mortality rate for journalists covering the conflict is over 10%, much higher than any other occupational group in Gaza. Incidents like the strike yesterday, or the mass killing when a news vehicle was hit in December, represent a broad trend of attacks on the only people documenting the genocide. Gaza is the most dangerous place in the world for journalists; meanwhile, Israel's blockade prevents foreign press from entering. The murder of the Al-Jazeera crew came just days after Netanyahu's announcement to take over Gaza City, and to Israel, provides an opportunity for the ethnic cleansing to be done without any media to watch.\n\nGaza conflict has become the deadliest period for journalists in recorded history\n\nSo how does Israel keep getting away with it, avoiding blowback? Three factors stand out. First is controlling the narrative: by barring most foreign media from even entering Gaza, Israel ensures that most reporting comes from locals: easier to track, easier to attack, and easier to discredit as \"Hamas terrorists.\" Second is hiding behind \"investigations:\" official probes on events are often slow and done in secret. In the case of Abu-Akleh, Israel only admitted responsibility months after the international eye was off the story. Third is dominating the narrative: governments can release \"classified\" claims without any evidence, framing the debate on their terms, while the murdered journalists have the only record of events.\n\nThis tactic has not started on October 7th, but the war in Gaza has exposed the IDF's history of lying. The strike yesterday was not an aberration from normal, but the endpoint of a culture where killing Palestinians carries no cost. It's part of an effort to strip Gaza of any witnesses. If Israel can kill the most prominent journalists in Palestine, it can kill anyone.\n\nTargeting journalists is a war crime against international law. That's not my opinion, that's codified in global treaties. Yet, to Israel, violations of said law don't carry consequences. Without the independent investigations that Israel denies, there will be a lack of enforcement of law, and the killings with continue. Each journalist's death becomes more normalized.\n\nFor us, the massacre yesterday should serve as a wake-up call. It should pressure governments, news outlets, and international organizations to confront the reality of genocide that is unfolding before our eyes. And in Gaza, the strategy of killing any witnesses is working. If we don't demand accountability now, it will be too late to stop the ethnic cleansing.",

Whether it be his constant references to Joe Biden as Sleepy Joe, or more controversially, the COVID-19 Virus as the \"China Virus,\" Trump tends to shy away from traditional names. But his recent naming of his tariff policies, \"Liberation Day,\" isn't just unusual. It's misleading, and at the expense of the American working class.\n\nOn Thursday, after many extensions of the tariff date for numerous promised deals that never came, Trump's tariffs finally took effect. Writing this at 1 AM, just under an hour ago at a minute past midnight, tariffs between 10% and 41% were applied to nearly 70 countries. It's hard to say what the effect of these tariffs will be. But it's certain that whether it be EVs or everyday electronics, the price of living in America will get even more expensive. At a time where job growth is declining(even if Trump denies it,) any increase in prices for consumers is sure to have a dramatic effect.\n\nTrump's economic policies and their impact on market volatility and consumer costs.\n\nThis won't be the first time Trump's tariff policies have taken effect. In his last term, albeit though tariffs were smaller, the Tax Foundation found that \"US tariffs [were] almost entirely borne by US firms and consumers.\" Rather than bringing the economic growth the administration promised, the policies instead estimated a net loss to the US economy of $16 billion annually, including more than $114 billion in losses to firms and consumers. While in his speeches, Trump may misunderstand his own policies and claim \"other nations will pay\" the idea that foreign nations bear the brunt of these levies is a myth that has been debunked time and again, as most of the cost of tariffs are seen by consumers, when companies are forced to raise prices as a result of buying goods at a higher cost.\n\nIndeed, rather than \"raise money for the country,\" the Tax Foundation estimated that this round of tariffs would reduce market income by 1.4 percent in 2026 and amount to an average tax increase per US household of $1,453 in 2026, making the tariffs the largest tax hike since 1993. As a result of the price increases that companies will be forced to make as a result of these dramatic tariffs, low-income households will be hit the hardest. At the grocery store, gas pump, and in restaurants, Americans are paying for unpopular tariffs they didn't ask for.\n\nIt's hard to find the rationale behind this policy so frowned upon by economists. One moment, Trump claims that it is about \"correcting\" deficits, a normal part of any developed economy. Other times, it's about \"the art of the deal.\" The next, it's about prioritizing American manufacturing.\n\nWhile these claims have been unsubstantiated, what there has been a consensus on is that if you make companies pay more for a good, they charge consumers more money. The Council for Foreign Relations estimates that consumers may see a near 2% increase. At a time where we are finally starting to bring the economy back to normal after the disruption that came with the pandemic, this would be disastrous.\n\nThe goal of tariffs doesn't seem to be having good economics in mind. It's for political goals. Trump's term has been notorious for neglecting checks and balances, and the round of tariffs are another way for him to offer his classic \"us vs them\" narrative without using Congress. Trump's political strategy has been contingent on an illusion of action in a world where statistics are not priorities to much of the nation.\n\nBut he won't be able to continue to advocate for illusory policy forever. If Trump's tariffs were truly a heaven-sent saviour for American manufacturing, the first wave of Trump's tariffs would not have seen a net economic loss of 245,000 jobs as according to Oxford. After the hundreds of billions in trade retaliation, the manufacturing sector lost more jobs than it gained. Industries using steel shed jobs quicker than steelmakers who were being \"protected,\" but had no one left to sell to. While it may seem obvious, when the cost of materials goes up, companies are forced to cut jobs, go out of business, or move production abroad, the opposite of the rhetoric you will see Trump talk about at a rally.\n\nThese tariffs are not liberating the middle class. They are isolating them from a better future, where the cost of living isn't something the average worker is highly considered with. The more we move down a trajectory of rejecting our allies, the more the same allies will reject our trade partnerships, and move towards China.\n\nTariffs may make for good slogans. But they have been shown to make bad policies. Americans should not mistake the name \"Liberation Day\" for economic freedom, and learn from the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930, which caused the Great Depression. Whether it be Trump's first term, or tariffs 100 years ago, tariffs have not had a good track record for the American worker.",

    "content": "With the onset of the Trump administration, the tech oligarchy has expanded its influence in dramatic fashion. Emerging out of the shadows and into the limelight is Peter Thiel's Palantir—an American software company with its hands in many different pies. Most dangerous of all is Palantir's interest in the Gaza Strip. As thousands of Gazan children lose their lives in a systematic genocide, Palantir stands to profit from the widespread destruction and chaos seen on an immeasurable scale.\n\nPalantir designs defense systems with heavy usage of artificial intelligence technology in order to provide militaries with the tools necessary to quell their opposition. On January 12, 2024, co-founders Alex Karp and Peter Thiel took a visit to Tel Aviv to discuss contracts with Israeli defense officials. Ever since then, Palantir has played an explicit role in the genocide of the Palestinian peoples. In a digital age fueled by intelligence, Gaza has become the first victim of a rapidly expanding techno-authoritarian trend. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), back in 2021, described its efforts as the world's first \"AI war\". The inclusion of Palantir's presence means the IDF is getting exactly what it wants for the foreseeable future.\n\nIt's no small secret that Israel routinely targets aid trucks for Palestinians. While Israel claims time and time again that their actions were mere \"mistakes\", the truth is a lot darker. Artificial intelligence targeting systems give the IDF an excuse to target civilians. While Israel claims their targeting is accurate, innocent civilians and children are the ones most affected. Israel continually cites Palantir's invasive, inaccurate, and imprecise A.I targeting systems as a defense against backlash. Purposefully, the IDF cuts off humanitarian help and then says that their targeting systems identified Hamas in the area. However, reality is clear: Israel is conducting a systematic genocide of the Palestinian people with the help of advanced technology from the United States.\n\nIn Israel's pursuit of uprooting Hamas, hospitals, schools, and churches have all been targeted. A U.N. Special Rapporteur singles out Palantir as uniquely responsible for the IDF's continued poor decision-making. Crucially, it's only going to get worse from here. TITAN is Palantir's newest project, heralded as \"next-generation Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance ground station enabled by Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to process data received from Space, High Altitude, Aerial and Terrestrial layers.\" TITAN is being developed for the U.S. Army; however, early prototypes and similar technologies are sure to be tested out on Palestinians as this article is being written.\n\nThe Trump Administration is deeply connected with Palantir, whether it be through J.D. Vance's personal relationship with Peter Thiel or Trump's partnership with the private company on collecting data on Americans. Gaza is simply the beginning of a much larger scheme. In the past decade, technology used to oppress Palestinians has been brought back home to be used on migrants living in the United States. With Trump's goal of hosting the biggest deportation campaign, it is a matter of when, not if, these technologies will be implemented in towns across the United States. On the border, Palantir's technology has already been deployed. \"The company has been an ICE contractor for more than a decade, spanning the Obama and Biden administrations, but its new scope of work signals an escalating role in immigration enforcement under President Trump.\" The principle is simple. If the technology can work to keep apartheid in check in Palestine, then the technology can work to keep immigrants oppressed back home in the U.S.\n\nToday, Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will take over the entire Gaza Strip. The U.S.-based company, Palantir, will play a key role in facilitating this process through the use of its intrusive artificial intelligence programs. It won't stop there. Palantir will not be satisfied with only Gaza. Thiel and the rest of the techno-autocrats are forming a future in which the citizens of the U.S lose their fundamental right to privacy. Inherently, our administration puts profits over lives in nearly every aspect of governance, whether it be in the Gaza Strip or right here at home.",

    "content": "For generations, the land that is now being used for DeSantis and Trump's political goals has been the area where the Miccosukee people have lived. After urban development by settlers forced many Native tribes away from Miami and Fort Lauderdale, tribes such as the Miccosukee have called the Everglades home, building villages throughout the marsh. The land has been considered sacred as providing refuge from the annihilation that faced so many Native tribes. \"These lands are not empty stretches of wilderness, nor are they merely backdrops to policy decisions —they are living, breathing homelands, deeply tied to the cultural, spiritual, and historical identity of Miccosukee and Florida Seminole people,\" said Lewis J. Johnson, principal chief of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma.\n\nThroughout the years, the Miccosukee and Seminole people have resisted construction that encroaches on their lands. In 1968, Dade County authorities planned to build the Big Cypress Jetport on the same land that the Miccosukee used for cultural practices. The airport was designed to be the \"world's largest airport.\" Fortunately, in 1969, a council of both conservationists and tribal members persuaded the former Florida Governor Kirk Jr. that the airport would be damaging to the Everglades. Construction was ordered to be halted, and only one runway remained.\n\nThe development of the airport is at the same site where ICE construction is now underway, surrounded on three sides by the homes of the Seminole and Miccosukee people. The complex, quickly erected with no notice to tribal leaders, now holds up to 5,000 in tents and trailers, and has become a necessary tool in carrying out President Trump's deportation agenda. For tribal leaders and environmental advocates, the project represents a collapse of their protection of the land they hold very sacred. In a space that was once used for ceremonial grounds, burial purposes, with 15 remaining traditional Miccosukee and Seminole villages, \"the constant rumbling of passing dump trucks drowns out the once familiar chirping of birds.\" On the land where families once prayed, hunted, and gathered, immigrants are being separated from their families.\n\nNative communities continue to fight for the protection of their sacred lands in the Everglades.\n\nBeyond facing pushback from indigenous groups, many conservationists are also raising alarm. The detention center sits in the Big Cypress National Preserve, an area designed to be a federally protected part of the Everglades, and an area that provides drinking water to much of South Florida. Conversations raise issue to the issue that no environmental study was done on the area, atypical of normal policy surrounding construction on federally protected land. The construction, which includes new pavement, air traffic, and lighting, threatens habitats for endangered species such as the Florida panther and bonneted bat.\n\nIn court, groups including Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity argued that the government bypassed the environmental reviews usually required under NEPA and the EPA, especially dangerous in one of the most key centers for biodiversity in America. In response, a judge ordered a two-week halt to new construction; however, operations at the facility are allowed to continue.\n\nIn another decision, a Miami court ruled the Florida corrections agency must give ICE the names of any people detained, and the federal agency can veto the detention of anyone it views as inappropriate. Yes, you heard that right. ICE provides oversight over the detention of victims.\n\nAs expected, the DeSantis administration has defended the project as lawful, criticising the court's decision to halt construction. A spokesperson for the attorney general stated, \"Judge Williams' order is wrong, and we will fight it. However, it does not shut down Alligator Alcatraz, which will continue to send illegal aliens back to where they came from,\" the statement read.\n\nIt isn't just the state of Florida that has defended the project. At a tour of the facility with Kristi Noem, Trump stated \"It's very appropriate, because I looked outside and it's not a place I want to go hiking anytime soon. We're surrounded by miles of treacherous swamp land, and the only way out is really deportation.\"\n\nAlthough the Trump administration has claimed otherwise, many of the people being detained in the camp are not criminals. Vichara recounts that her husband went to routine immigration appointments before randomly being detained. Once in the center, many describe it as a \"concentration camp\" due to the conditions, but the story doesn't get much better. Detainees such as Collado, who need blood pressure medication, are denied access to their medication, a violation of basic human rights under international law and the 8th Amendment. In the camp, detainees like Juan Panma recount only being able to shower every four days, and being kept in a \"cage\" with 32 other immigrants. Conditions like these, especially in a camp with a lack of access to healthcare, are a breeding ground to spread disease.\n\nThe federal court hearing in Miami later this month could determine whether the state must conduct a full environmental impact study, a process that could delay or even halt the project. Furthermore, advocacy groups such as the ACLU are suing the administration for denying due process and rights to legal counsel for immigrants detained in the facility.\n\nFor now, the lights of Alligator Alcatraz keep shining across the Everglades night, a cruel reminder to its residents of a battle they thought they won in 1968.",

    "content": "The second Trump administration, since day one, has set its sights on the nation's best and brightest universities. Countless excuses for the attacks are tossed around, including but not limited to: antisemitism, communist indoctrination, trans sports policies, or general \"wokeness\". However, let's call it as it is: a deep descent into authoritarianism. Indeed, the first step in the fascist playbook is to starve its people of the right to education. Colleges resist conservatism. Campuses across the nation are ripe with dissent and anger towards an administration they view as encroaching on their civil liberties. President Trump aims to punish the institutions themselves for not kissing the ring. From a cultural standpoint, universities represent political progress on a wide scale, with some of the nation's most progressive movements being born out of the dorm rooms of 20-something-year-olds. In the pursuit of crushing dissent with an iron fist, the Trump administration should expect the youth of today to put up a fight against authoritarianism.\n\nThe precedent for attacking universities has already been set. By 1933, Germany's universities were filled with exactly one ideology: Nazism. Universities across the country were shouting Hitler's name, while any sentiment regarding sympathy for Jews was entirely eradicated. The fascist state of Germany in the early 20th century recognized the danger posed by an educated population. Propaganda is harder to disseminate if people can see through it. In the United States, college campuses have demonstrated their resilience in the face of infringements on their rights. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) was formed during the Civil Rights Movement as an effort to practice direct political protest. Shortly after, in 1970, students once again rallied around anti-war sentiment in Vietnam. The following decade, protests against South African apartheid proliferated across the nation to get institutions to divest from companies that operated in the state. Time and time again, students protesting against the state's decisions have been on the right side of history. Meanwhile, governments that suppress academic freedom are historically associated with autocracy.\n\nThe primary vehicle the Trump administration utilizes for its attacks on college is executive orders. Crucially, with the stroke of a pen, one man's will becomes the supreme law of the land. Executive orders have impacted colleges on many separate fronts. An executive order against antisemitism blatantly propelled xenophobia by calling for the monitoring, investigation, and removal of foreign students accused of antisemitic acts. An executive order against DEI threatened to add frivolous lawsuits to the laundry list of issues that colleges must deal with. However, it is important to note, the E.O. against DEI has been blocked via preliminary injunction as of April 24th. Next, anti-trans executive orders hurt institutions that allow transgender athletes by cutting their funding. Indeed, new executive orders hurt Title XI policies of the past and implement transphobic directives for colleges to follow. On immigration, Trump signed an executive order repealing the Biden administration's classification of schools, hospitals, health clinics, and churches as sensitive areas meant to have limited ICE actions. For university students, this means college campuses will be flooded with full force by ICE. Executive action has already seeped its way into an overwhelming number of different matters, affecting students' livelihoods. Precisely, that is the Trump administration's goal. With a quick barrage of executive actions, Trump is hoping that a couple of them fly directly past the courts. For example, a couple of orders have been granted preliminary injunctions, but by and large, executive action surrounding immigration has been upheld. The goal is to swarm colleges with an ultimatum: either follow the list of demands or lose funding. Are institutions falling for the bait?\n\nLeading universities have remained steadfast while staring down the barrel of the sweeping list of demands made by the Trump Administration. Most notable of all is Harvard. Alan Garber, President of Harvard University, states, \"The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights\". However, Trump is willing to overreach with worrisome escalations. Just one day ago, The Guardian reports that the Trump administration is threatening to strip Harvard University of its lucrative patents accumulated over the years. No comment has been made from Harvard University yet. While the nation's oldest and most prestigious university fights back, its Ivy League counterparts take a much different approach, buying into the government's demands. Columbia and Brown have both signed million-dollar settlements to restore access to federal research funding. The ultimatum is working. The next domino that could potentially fall is the University of California, Los Angeles–the nation's number one public university. The Trump administration offered a one-billion-dollar settlement to UCLA. Although the demands are not explicitly stated to the public, we can assume similar conditions are expected to be met.\n\nIn the settlements, colleges are now disclosing standardized test scores, grade-point averages, and the race of applicants. The Trump administration claims this is an effort to bring back merit-based acceptance. However, historically, when prestigious universities try to implement merit-based applications, they place too much emphasis on numbers and not enough on the student's story. For example, if a certain applicant experienced hardships and struggles that could rationalize a lower GPA and lower test scores, then their chances of admission are now much lower after this settlement. In the upcoming years, the focus on ending opportunities for the disadvantaged in favor of \"merit\" will be detrimental to millions of struggling students hoping to get into top universities as a way to ameliorate their conditions. The Trump administration sugar-coats its reckless actions as \"ending wokeness,\" but really, the goal is to end upward mobility. The education of the poor is uniquely harmful to an administration that wants to further marginalize communities. Moreover, international students will be particularly affected in a myriad of ways by Trump's crackdown on immigration. As part of our current administration's fight against higher education, a common theme has been anger with the number of admits hailing from places across the globe. Thousands of current international students have had their legal status revoked as well. Who stands to benefit here? Once again, not the American people. According to a Professor of Economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, \"International college students benefit the U.S. economy by contributing billions in tuition and living expenses, helping maintain the financial viability of many universities.\" Trump repeats empty promises of reducing the trade deficit, yet day after day, he signs executive orders antithetical to his goal. Bringing in international students reduces the trade deficit as these students pay \"out-of-state tuition fees\" at substantially higher rates. America's trade surplus in the education sector has grown at an exponential rate, adding to our overall economic growth. However, Trump's xenophobic interests cloud reason, potentially costing our economy billions of dollars.\n\nHistory proves that higher education is critical to a stable democracy, precisely why it has become a primary target of the current administration in power. As corruption seeps its way into every facet of government, it is important to realize that colleges are the first line of defense. Campuses across the nation take to protesting the intrusive policies our legislators push forward as an attempt to fight back. The first step the autocrat takes is to make sure no one can resist. The key to resistance is education. So, educate yourselves and those around you. Fight back, they won't expect it.",

    "content": "Leading up to Trump's 2024 election victory, Donald Trump campaigned (along with RFK) that America would have the \"cleanest air and water on the planet.\" However, in practice, his policies have included the deregulation of the Environmental Protection Agency, allowing corporations to engage in environmentally harmful practices without restraint. Specifically, since retaking office, Trump has dismantled a variety of environmental protections: clean water regulations, limits on toxic PFAS chemicals, and slashed ecological budgets. What has naturally occurred is a dangerous risk of contamination across the nation's water supplies, especially for our poorest communities.\n\nA major part of the crisis stems from Trump's rollback of the Clean Water Act. During his first term, he already removed federal protection for millions of acres of wetlands, which meant that a developer could discharge pollutants into hundreds of thousands of miles of streams without any federal regulation. Now, in his second term, Trump's administration has doubled down, stating that \"states should take the lead in regulating waterways.\" But in practice, many states lack the budgets, staff, and political will to enforce water regulations against the same industries that lobby the same politicians into power.\n\nFurthermore, the way the administration has handled toxic PFAS chemicals has been even more dangerous. After decades of scientific literature linking PFAS exposure to cancer and a multitude of other deadly diseases, the Biden administration finally enforced maximum contaminant levels for six of the most dangerous compounds, such as PFOA, PFOS, and GenX. But, within just a few months of power, the EPA under Trump has started to weaken the rules, extending compliance deadlines to 2031, and rescinding limits for chemicals such as GenX. Unsurprisingly, this decision, which will likely come at the cost of thousands of lives, was influenced by the chemical manufacturer and water utility lobby.\n\nThe consequences of this decision could be staggering. Now, over 73 million Americans can be exposed to unsafe levels of PFAS in their own tap water. In states like Michigan, which once had stricter standards than the federal government, the rollback will come with weaker protections, disproportionately affecting pregnant women and children.\n\nThis decision isn't just about the chemical manufacturer lobby or PFAS. It is an example of Trump's war on our own infrastructure. While 90 percent of Americans rely on publicly provided water, investment in the public sector under the administration is drastically declining. This comes at a time when increased investment is necessary. The EPA recently concluded that the U.S. faces a $625 billion investment shortfall in our water systems over the next 20 years. Across the nation, pipes are starting to corrode, old storage tanks are crumbling, and sanitation systems are faltering. As a result, lead, arsenic, microplastics, and other forms of dangerous bacteria risk entering our water supply. Biden's initiative to replace the 9 million lead service lines in desperate for renewal barely scratched the surface, replacing only 367,000 pipes before funding was frozen under Trump's EPA.\n\nThis risks creating a public health crisis. As countless studies have documented, elevated levels of lead in our water can lead to developmental harm in children. For the wider population, illnesses from bacterial contamination can spread. Cancer clusters can appear in towns where PFAS leach into groundwater. While the Trump admin may frame cuts as \"efficiency,\" the cost of the policy falls onto the public. A deregulation of toxic exposures, if anything, will increase healthcare costs felt by the consumer, and reduce worker productivity, especially in low-income communities that rely the most on public infrastructure. Trump's deregulatory assault undermines decades of progress for environmental health.\n\nThe erosion of our most important protections on our water is also attacking our most iconic rivers. This year, the advocacy group American Rivers named the iconic Mississippi River as the nation's most endangered river as a result of chemical runoff, algae blooms, and flooding worsened by Trump's weakening of FEMA. In Virginia, the explosive and often unregulated growth of data centers has strained the Rappahannock River, and in West Virginia, mining discharge left mostly unchecked has started to ruin the Cherry River.\n\nAmerica's water crisis will certainly not be solved through deregulation. Nor will it be solved through modest measures. It requires a massive investment in public infrastructure, paired with regulations on corporations. Anything short of that will leave millions of Americans drinking contaminated water while corporations stand to pocket the profits.",
